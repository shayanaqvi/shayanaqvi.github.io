      <h2>Why does this website look like vanilla HTML?</h2>
      <p>It does, and it does on purpose.</p>
      <p>It's mostly a personal preference: I like these kinds of websites, and while I don't get to flex my
        HTML/CSS/design skillz, I get to make a website I'm happy with that I mostly like.</p>
      <p>Anything could happen though, and I doubt it's going to look like this forever.</p>
      <h2>More Information</h2>
      <p>Parts of this site's code are rather hacky/undesirable, but this is all stuff that will be fixed in due
        time. Take a look at the GIF below.</p>
      <img class="small-gif" src="./under-construction.gif" style="width: 40px"
        alt="GIF of a person constructing something">
      <p>This entire website is written in plain HTML and CSS. No CMSs or static site generators have been used. There
        are cons to this approach, but the simplicity (not
        speed) of maintaining such a site is very appealing.</p>
      <p>I have a template HTML file, into which I insert the
        contents of any new articles. The drawback of this approach is (a) it's slow; and (b) tweaking the template
        file is something that requires a bit of time, since I have to translate the changes to all HTML files that
        are
        based off of the template.</p>
      <p>Using a good text editor makes this process much more palatable: just open up all the files to change, define
        a
        macro, and off you go! I like the <a href="https://helix-editor.com">Helix</a> text editor.</p>
      <p>The font is Libertinus Serif. It's a very pretty
        font.</p>
      <p>The light mode colours are <span style="background: #f3efe0; color: #4a4555;">#f3efe0</span> for the
        background, <span style="background: #4a4555; color: #f3efe0;">#4a4555</span> for the foreground, and <span
          style="background: #848c2c; color: #f3efe0">#848c2c</span> as an accent.</p>
      <p>For dark mode, <span style="background: #163c3c; color: #f9cd8a;">#163c3c</span> for the background, <span
          style="background: #f9cd8a; color: #163c3c;">#f9cd8a</span> for the foreground, and <span
          style="background: #c0cc3f; color: #163c3c;">#c0cc3f</span> as an accent.</p>
