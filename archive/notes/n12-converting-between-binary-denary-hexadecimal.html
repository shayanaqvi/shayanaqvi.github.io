      <h1>Converting Between Binary/Denary/Hexadecimal</h1>
      <p>Part of AS Computer Science, but also IGCSE (maybe GCSE) Computer Science too, in case you're wondering.</p>

      <h2>Binary to Denary</h2>
      <p>Binary headers! These are the values of 2 to the <em>x</em>th value. Use as many as are required for your
        particular
        binary string.</p>
      <p>Suppose we have <code>00101100</code>. We can simply add the values of the headers that correspond to each 1,
        as
        shown below.</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>128</th>
          <th>64</th>
          <th>32</th>
          <th>16</th>
          <th>8</th>
          <th>4</th>
          <th>2</th>
          <th>1</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>1</td>

      </table>
      <p>32 + 8 + 4 = 44</p>


      <h2>Denary to Binary</h2>
      <p>This is done through successive division by 2 until we reach 0. Remainders will always be either 1 or 0. Using
        our
        denary value from above, 44:</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Divisor</th>
          <th>Dividend</th>
          <th>Remainder</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>44</td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>22</td>
          <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>11</td>
          <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td></td>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>We read the remainders from bottom to the top to get our final value. In this case, we get <code>101100</code>.
        This
        value fits into a 6-bit register, so in order make it fit into an 8-bit register, we will add 2 zeroes to the
        left of
        the string, resulting in <code>00101100</code>.</p>

      <h2>Binary to Hexadecimal</h2>
      <p>A table is needed for this. It's large, but you don't need to memorise anything once you understand the pattern
        that
        lies within it.</p>

      </code>
      <p>Look at the binary values. See how they increase? Once you see this pattern, you can make this table on the
        fly.</p>
      <p>Herein lies our method of conversion. Say we have a binary value of <code>00111100</code>. We split this value
        into
        groups of 4, in this case <code>0011</code> and <code>1100</code>. Then we find their corresponding values in
        this
        table. In this case, we have <code>3</code> and <code>C</code>: <code>3C</code>.</p>
      <p>If we find ourselves with a binary value that cannot be split into groups of 4, then we add zeroes, as needed,
        to
        make a complete group of 4. For example, if we have a 6-bit value: <code>010101</code>, then we would split it
        as
        such: <code>0001</code> and <code>0101</code>. Remember that we read these values from right to left.</p>

      <h2>Hexadecimal to Binary</h2>
      <p>The same operation as above. Split the hexadecimal value into individual parts, and find their corresponding
        binary
        values in the table above.</p>

      <h2>Denary to Hexadecimal</h2>
      <p>Successive division by 16. Suppose we have a denary value of 130.</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Divisor</th>
          <th>Dividend</th>
          <th>Remainder</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>16</td>
          <td>130</td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>16</td>
          <td>8</td>
          <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td></td>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>8</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>This leaves us with a hexadecimal value of 82. If you ever get remainders > 9, translate them into their
        corresponding
        letters.</p>

      <h2>Hexadecimal to Denary</h2>
      <p>Suppose with have a hexadecimal value of <code>AE6</code>.</p>
      <p>\((A \times 256) + (E \times 16) + (6 \times 1)\)</p>
      <p>Alternatively,</p>
      <p>\((10 \times 256) + (14 \times 16) + (6 \times 1)\)</p>
      <p>Then,</p>
      <p>\(2560 + 224 + 6 = 2790\)</p>

      <p>Essentially, we split the HEX value in to individual values. <code>AE6</code> becomes <code>A</code>,
        <code>E</code>,
        and <code>6</code>.
      </p>
      <p>Then, we multiple each individual value by its corresponding hexadecimal heading: 16 to the <em>x</em>th
        power,
        where
        <em>x</em> scales with the number of individual values.
      </p>
      <p>After multiplying, we sum them together, and we have our denary value.</p>
      <h2>Common Patterns</h2>
      <p>We can notice that conversion <em>from</em> a denary value into another number system follows a similar
        convention:
        successive division by the number of values of that number system. Base 16 means division by 16, base 2 means
        division
        by 2.</p>
      <p>We can also see that conversion <em>to</em> a denary value involves multiplication and addition with the
        headers of
        the corresponding number system.</p>
