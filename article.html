          <p class="article-date">31/07/2023</p>
          <p>I came across an article by Rolf Dobelli; it’s about avoiding the
            news. I don’t have much new to say about news in particular, not at this
            moment in time, but I just wanted to share some insights from this
            article that I found interesting. I don’t necessarily agree with all of
            these, but I found them interesting nonetheless.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“Take the following event. A car drives over a bridge, and the
              bridge collapses. What does the news media focus on? On the car. On the
              person in the car. Where he came from. Where he planned to go. How he
              experienced the crash (if he survived). What kind of person he is (was).
              But – that is all completely irrelevant. What’s relevant? The structural
              stability of the bridge. That’s the underlying risk that has been
              lurking and could lurk in other bridges. That is the lesson to be
              learned from this event. The car doesn’t matter at all. Any car could
              have caused the bridge to collapse. It could have been a strong wind or
              a dog walking over the bridge. So, why does the media cover the car?
              Because it’s flashy, it’s dramatic, it’s a person (non-­‐abstract), and
              it’s news that’s cheap to produce.”</li>
            <li>“You don’t visit Paris for just one hour or speed through the Museum
              of Modern Art in two minutes. Why not? Because the brain needs spool-up
              time. Building up concentration takes a minimum of a 10­‐minute read.
              Given less time, your brain will process the information superficially
              and barely store it. News pieces are like wind hitting your cheek. Ask
              yourself: What are the top ten news items from a month ago (that are no
              longer in the news today)? If you have a hard time remembering, you are
              not alone. Why would you want to consume something that doesn’t add to
              your body of knowledge?”</li>
            <li>“News works like a drug. As stories develop, we naturally want to
              know how they continue. With hundreds of arbitrary story lines in our
              heads, this craving is increasingly compelling and hard to ignore.”</li>
            <li>“We are training our brains to pay attention to the crap.”</li>
            <li>“Fame is misleading because generally people become famous for
              reasons that have little relevance to our lives. The media grants fame
              to movie stars and news anchors for scant reason. News sunders the
              relationship between reputation and achievement. The tragedy is that pop
              notoriety crowds out the achievements of those who make more substantive
              contributions.”</li>
            <li>“Good professional journalists take time with their stories,
              authenticate their facts and try to think things through. But like any
              profession, journalism has some incompetent, unfair practitioners who
              don’t have the time – or the capacity – for deep analysis. You might not
              be able to tell the difference between a polished professional report
              and a rushed, glib, paid-­‐by-­‐the-­‐piece article by a writer with an
              ax to grind. It all looks like news. My estimate: fewer than 10% of the
              news stories are original. Less than 1% are truly investigative. And
              only once every 50 years do journalists uncover a Watergate. Many
              reporters cobble together the rest of the news from other people’s
              reports, common knowledge, shallow thinking and whatever the journalist
              can find on the internet. Some reporters copy from each other or refer
              to old pieces, without necessarily catching up with any interim
              corrections. The copying and the copying of the copies multiply the
              flaws in the stories and their irrelevance.”</li>
            <li>“Stories are selected or slanted to please advertisers (advertising
              bias) or the owners of the media (corporate bias), and each media outlet
              has a tendency to report what everyone else is reporting, and to avoid
              stories that will offend anyone (mainstream bias).”</li>
            <li>“Hold on: do we really want news reporters to set the public
              agenda?”</li>
            <li>“News stories are overwhelmingly about things you cannot
              influence.”</li>
