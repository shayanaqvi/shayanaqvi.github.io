      <h1>Endeavours with Blender</h1>
      <p>About a year ago/year and a half ago, I did some dabbling around with Blender. Here is some of the stuff I
        modeled.
        All of these are existing products.</p>
      <h2>Braun BC12 Alarm Clock</h2>
      <p><em>Something</em> went wrong with the shape of the clock; it's weirdly polygonal. But I still like it.</p>

      <p>A close-up of the hands:</p>

      <p>Some of the knobs/dials on the back:</p>

      <h2>Bench + Table (scene)</h2>
      <p>This scene uses furniture I modelled from Fredericia (a recurring theme). I am quite partial
        to the
        floor tiling, though I would probably hate it in real life.</p>
      <figure>

          alt="a set consisting of a bench and a table, with some fancy floor tiling and photos on the walls">
      </figure>
      <p>The texturing on the legs of the benches did go a bit awry.</p>

      <h2>Mogensen Table</h2>
      <p>The table from the scene above.</p>
      <figure>

      <h2>Pato Chair</h2>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/blender/bl_pato2.jpg" alt="front profile of the same chair">
      </figure>

      <h2>J64 Chair</h2>
      <p>The texturing on the legs is pretty bad. Didn't notice it until <em>after</em> it had spent the amount of hours
        it had rendering.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/blender/bl_j64.png" alt="a chair with some unfortunate texturing on the legs">
      </figure>

      <h2>Playdate</h2>
      <p>Panic's Playdate. It was quite fun to model.</p>
      <figure>

      <figure>

      <figure>

      </figure>

      <h2>The Donut</h2>
      <p>Can't miss this. I find the background rather unforuntate.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>

      <p>Thus, my journey with Blender concluded. It was fun while it lasted.</p>
