      <h1>Going Back to DWM</h1>
      <p class="shout">I've replaced this article with <a href="./24-setting-up-dwm.html">Setting up DWM</a>. Check that out instead.</p>
      <h2>Dependencies</h2>
      <p>Let's get dependencies sorted out. On Void Linux, <code>sudo xbps-install base-devel libX11-devel libXft-devel
          libXinerama-devel freetype-devel fontconfig-devel</code>.</p>
      <h2>Getting the source code</h2>
      <p>Create a directory where you'll clone the source code. Generally, it seems like DWM, Dmenu and ST are installed
        together. I don't need ST, so I won't install that. I'll keep on using the good ol' xfce4-terminal.</p>
      <p><code>cd</code> into this new directory. Then,</p>

      <pre><code>git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm
git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu</code></pre>

      <h2>Building</h2>
      <p>Now, let's build DWM first. Change directory to wherever the DWM source code is. Then, run <code>make</code>
        followed by <code>sudo make clean install</code>.</p>
      <p>You can follow the same procedure for Dmenu and/or ST.</p>
      <h2>Starting DWM</h2>
      <p>You can start DWM from a TTY. The executable produced is located at <code>/usr/local/bin/dwm</code>. If you use
        startx, then <code>startx /usr/local/bin/dwm</code>. This could be automated; I don't have that know-how.</p>
      <p>If you use a display manager, then we'll need to create a <code>.desktop</code> file.</p>
      <p><code>touch dwm.desktop</code>. We'll put the following content in it:</p>

      <pre><code>[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=DWM
Comment=Dynamic Window Manager
Exec=/usr/local/bin/dwm
Icon=dwm
Type=XSession</code></pre>

      <p>This file goes in <code>/usr/share/xsessions</code>. DWM should now be selectable from your display manager.
      </p>
      <h2>Utilities</h2>
      <p>Picom for compositing. Nitrogen to set a wallpaper.</p>
      <h2>Making Edits</h2>
      <p>The unfortunate situation is that you're going to have to rebuild DWM anytime you modify its config file. Then
        you log out and log back in.</p>
