      <h1>Third-Party Youtube Clients</h1>
      <p>My experience with these (on the desktop) has generally not been great. There's always some kind of problem:
        the app is too slow, there are problems with video playback and so on and so forth.</p>
      <p>While I really dislike its name, FreeTube is the first third-party Youtube client I've used that doesn't have
        these problems. It's been great so far! Good stuff!</p>
