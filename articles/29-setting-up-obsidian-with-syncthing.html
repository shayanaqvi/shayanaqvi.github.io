      <h1>Setting up Obsidian with Syncthing</h1>
      <p>I've known of Syncthing for a while but I got around to setting it up a few days ago.</p>
      <p>Note that my usage of Obsidian is very simple; nothing more than tasks and a calendar. I've heard of
        conflict issues with larger note collections, but there is a bit in this article about mitigating that issue.
        I'm not aware of how well it works for those larger note collections.</p>

      <h2>Setting up Syncthing</h2>
      <p>I'm not going to write another getting started guide for this. There are already plenty. The official <a
          href="https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html">getting started</a> guide is great!</p>

      <h2>The <code>.obsidian</code> folder</h2>
      <p>I definitely do not want this folder to sync. I'm using different themes/configurations on my phone and
        computer. The official Syncthing documentation has a bit on <a
          href="https://docs.syncthing.net/users/ignoring.html">ignoring files</a>.</p>
      <p>For our purposes, simply create a <code>.stignore</code> file. In that, put <code>.obsidian</code>. That's it!
        Do the same on your phone. That'll keep both configurations separate.</p>

      <h2>Mitigating Conflicts</h2>
      <p>You're going to have to do this on both devices, but the procedure is the same for both. The only difference is
        opening the web GUI on the phone. There's a thing for that in the menu.</p>

      <p>Now, in the web GUI, go to Actions>Advanced.</p>

        <img src="../images/syncthing-obsidian/st1.png" alt="a screenshot of the location of the relevant menu">
      </figure>
      <p>From here, select your Obsidian folder from the folders tab.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/syncthing-obsidian/st2.png" alt="a screenshot showing the folder whose settings we need to change">
      </figure>
      <p>Search for an option named "Max Conflicts". Set that value to 0. From my understanding, this option syncs only
        the version of any file with the latest modification, and <em>should</em> mitigate any potential conflicts.</p>
      <p>That's it!</p>
