        <h1>2-Dimensional Arrays</h1>

        <p>All explanations I’ve heard from teachers AND from the few textbooks
        I’ve read have such a convoluted explanation of this data structure.</p>
        <p>To put it simply, a 2-Dimensional array is nothing more than a single
        array that contains multiple other arrays. That’s it!</p>
        <pre><code>2d_array = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]</code></pre>
        <p>When you arrange it like this, you see the tabular structure everyone
        talks about.</p>
        <p>The other thing to know is how to loop through such an array. You’ll
        need exactly 2 loops for this.</p>
        <p>One loop will loop through the array that contains the other arrays
        as you would regularly.</p>
        <pre><code>array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for array in array1:
    print(array)</code></pre>
        <p>When you loop through this sort of array, you loop through each
        individual element, right?</p>
        <p>If we let:</p>
        <pre><code>a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
c = [7, 8, 9]</code></pre>
        <p>Then looping through an array with these arrays is no different:</p>
        <pre><code>array2 = [a, b, c]

for array in array2:
    print(array)</code></pre>
        <p>At any given moment, our loop variable (<code>array</code>) will hold
        either <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, or <code>c</code>.</p>
        <p>This is when you require your second loop, to loop through the
        currently selected array.</p>
        <pre><code>array2 = [a, b, c]

for array in array2: #loop through array2
    for item in array: #loop through the currently selected array
        print(item)</code></pre>
        <p>When you look at a 2D array with such a definition, it becomes a lot
        easier to scale up to however many dimensions you need.</p>
