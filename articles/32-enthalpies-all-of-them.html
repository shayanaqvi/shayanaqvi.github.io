      <h2 id="formation">Enthalpy Change of Formation (\(\Delta H_F\))</h2>
      <p>The change in enthalpy when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements, measured under standard conditions.</p>
      <p class="shout">\(\frac{1}{2}H_2 + \frac{1}{2}Cl_2 \rightarrow HCl\)</p>
      <p>Remember: 1 mole of a compound is formed!</p>

      <h2 id="combustion">Enthalpy Change of Combustion (\(\Delta H_C\))</h2>
      <p>The change in enthalpy when 1 mole of a compound is completely combusted (burned in oxygen), measured under standard conditions.</p>
      <p class="shout">\(C + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2\)</p>
      <p>Note that this is the enthalpy of combustion of carbon AND the enthalpy of formation of carbon dioxide.</p>

      <h2 id="neutralization">Enthalpy Change of Neutralization (\(\Delta H_N\))</h2>
      <p>The change in enthalpy when 1 mole of water is formed as a result of an acid/base reaction, measured under standard conditions. It generally lies around \(-57kJ/mol\) for a reaction involving strong acids and bases. For weaker acids/bases, it is greater than \(-57kJ/mol\).</p>
      <p class="shout">\(HCl + NaOH \rightarrow NaCl + H_2O\)</p>

      <h2 id="reaction">Enthalpy Change of Reaction (\(\Delta H_R\))</h2>
      <p>The change in enthalpy of a chemical reaction when it occurs in the molar ratios/stoichiometric quantities outlined by a given chemical equation, measured under standard conditions. The example from before works for this definition too:</p>
      <p class="shout">\(HCl + NaOH \rightarrow NaCl + H_2O\)</p>

      <h2 id="atomization">Enthalpy Change of Atomization (\(\Delta H_{AT}\))</h2>
      <p>The change in enthalpy when 1 mole of gaseous atoms are formed from its element, measured under standard conditions.</p>
      <p class="shout">\(\frac{1}{2}I_2(s) \rightarrow I(g)\)</p>
      <p>Here, the \(\Delta H_{AT}\) is the energy needed to break the \(I-I\) covalent bond + the Van der Waals forces in that molecule.</p>
      <p class="shout">\(\frac{1}{2}Cl_2(g) \rightarrow Cl(g)\)</p>
      <p>Here, the \(\Delta H_{AT}\) is only the energy needed to break the \(Cl-Cl\) covalent bond, since the molecule is already gaseous.</p>

      <h2 id="lattice">Lattice Energy (\(\Delta H_{LE}\))</h2>
      <p>The change in enthalpy when 1 mole of a solid ionic lattice is formed from its constituent gaseous ions, measured under standard conditions.</p>
      <p class="shout">\(2Na^+(g) + SO^{2-}_4(g) \rightarrow Na_2SO_4(s)\)</p>

      <h2 id="affinity">Electron Affinity (\(\Delta H_{EA}\))</h2>
      <p>This is the polar opposite of ionization energy: the change in enthalpy when 1 mole of electrons are gained by gaseous atoms to form negatively charged ions.</p>
      <p>Like with ionization energy, there are different definitions for each electron affinity. Take the first: the change in enthalpy when 1 mole of electrons are gained by gaseous atoms to form gaseous 1- ions. You can scale your definitions as needed.</p>
      <p>Note that first electron affinities are always negative (exothermic).</p>
      <p class="shout">\(Cl(g) + e^- \rightarrow Cl^- (g)\)</p>
