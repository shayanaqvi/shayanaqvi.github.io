      <h1>Youtube Through RSS</h1>
      <p>Following Youtube channels through RSS is a great quality-of-life
        improvement. I don’t expect this "feature" to last particularly long given where
        Google is taking the site, but it works for now.</p>
      <h2 id="getting-a-feed-for-a-channel">Getting a feed for a channel</h2>
      <p>This isn’t the easiest thing. There are two methods I am aware
        of.</p>
      <p>The first way I know of is to:
      <ol>
        <li>go to the channel you want to follow</li>
        <li>inspect page source</li>
        <li>search for “RSS”</li>
        <figure>
          <img src="../images/youtube-rss/ytrss_screenshot1.png"
            alt="a screenshot of the RSS link in the page source of a Youtube channel" />
        </figure>
        <li>copy the URL containing the channel ID</li>
        <li>add this to your feed reader</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p>The second makes things a bit easier, but it’s also somewhat
        undesirable:
      <ol>
        <li>sign up for a feed reader (like feedly)</li>
        <li>follow the Youtube channels you want to follow</li>
        <li>export the feeds</li>
        <li>import them to your feed reader</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p>I suppose this second method is useful if you want to import a lot of Youtube feeds at once.</p>
      <p>The consumption experience is better if you can get a feed reader
        that can display webpages. I use Thunderbird with uBlock, and this is a
        good enough way for me to follow Youtube.</p>
