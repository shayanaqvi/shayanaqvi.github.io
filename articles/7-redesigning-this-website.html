      <h1>Redesigning this Website</h1>
      <p>I enjoy reading about efforts to redesign, so I thought I’d do my
        own.</p>
      <p>I did like this site’s old design. But I could have done
        better. Here’s a screenshot of the “original”:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/webredo/webredo_scr0.png" alt="screenshot of the original website" /><br />
        <figcaption>The "original"</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I started out in Figma with this:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/webredo/webredo_scr1.png"
          alt="image of my first redesign attempt, with colours, gradients and a vertical navigation bar" />
      </figure>
      <p>It carries over the vertical navigation bar from the original. It was alright, but
        I didn’t particularly love the colours and fonts. The same, but with
        solid colours instead of gradients:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/webredo/webredo_scr2.png"
          alt="further refinement of the first redesign attempt, with solid colours this time" /><br />
      </figure>
      <p>Had a go with a high-contrast/monochrome version of this design. I
        liked it more.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/webredo/webredo_scr3.png"
          alt="monochrome version of the first redesign; black background for the page" /><br />
      </figure>
      <p>Getting closer to the new layout. It is somewhat inspired from the website of Collaborative Fund.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/webredo/webredo_scr4.png"
          alt="another monochrome version of the first redesign, this time with a different font and using a beige colour throughout" />
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/webredo/webredo_scr6.png"
          alt="this iteration was similar to the one before; the only difference is the navigation bar is now horizontal and positioned at the top of the page" />
        <figcaption>a more sensible layout</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Now came the task of translating this design to HTML and CSS. I found it not
        <em>too</em> difficult a task. It was manageable, especially with help
        from Figma’s dev tools thingy.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/webredo/webredo_scr7.png" alt="my attempt to translate the previous design to HTML and CSS" />
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img style="display: block; width: 250px; margin: 0 auto;" src="../images/webredo/webredo_scr5.png"
          alt="a screenshot of Figma's developer tools" />
        <figcaption>Figma's developer tools</figcaption>
      </figure><br>
      <p>Now with padding/margins…</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/webredo/webredo_scr8.png"
          alt="padding and margins added to everything; still the same layout as before" />
      </figure>
      <p>And a mobile layout…</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/webredo/webredo_scr9.png" alt="different styling for mobile devices" />
      </figure>
      <p>The dark mode colour scheme is the same as I mentioned in <a href="./creatingacolourscheme.html">this</a>
        article.
        It’s a <em>bit</em> like Solarized, but a bit warmer in its colour choice. This also shows the
        footer thing.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/webredo/webredo_scr10.png" alt="the same web page but now with a dark mode" />
      </figure>
      <p>Light mode colours remained the same as before.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/webredo/webredo_scr11.png" alt="adjusted light mode colours" />
      </figure>
      <p>The same design, but starting to make use of accent colours. I chose red, green,
        and blue by accident. I only realized I had done this later on. But I
        like it still.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/webredo/webredo_scr12.png" alt="accent colours added" />
      </figure>
      <p>Then the iconography in the footer boxes. I did the web and mail icons myself.
        The RSS icon was pre-made. These are inline SVGs. I chose to do
        this so that I could manipulate their colours without fussing around
        with filters. It will, however, make it much harder to change these
        icons in the future.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/webredo/webredo_scr14.png" alt="added SVG icons to the footer section of the webpage" />
      </figure>
      <p>Now comes the template file. A fun task.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/webredo/webredo_scr15.png" alt="translating the web page layout to a template HTML file" />
      </figure>
      <p>Pretty close now to the final:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/webredo/webredo_scr16.png" alt="further adjustment of the dark mode, with a very loud green accent" />
      </figure>
      <p>And the final! The difference between this and the screenshot above is the colours. The green is too bright
        above,
        a
        bit of a sore sight for a so-called “dark mode”.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/webredo/webredo_scr17.png" alt="toned down green accent. the final version." />
      </figure>
      <p>There we are!</p>
      <p>I’m happy with this for now, and I hope I won’t bother rewriting this
        site’s CSS again. It’s a novel thing to do, but a bit draining at
        times. Which one do you like?</p>
