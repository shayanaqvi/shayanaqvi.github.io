      <h1>A Breath of Fresh Air</h1>
      <p>I use an old iMac. It's from 2012, and (obviously) came with macOS. The last version of macOS this thing got
        was
        Catalina. It ran like trash. Literally trash. I couldn't even right-click in peace, without the damn thing
        freezing.
      </p>
      <p>My brother recommended I give Linux a try, and I did. What a change it made! A breath of fresh air! I could
        actually
        use the computer again.</p>
      <p>Once that honeymoon period wore off, I found that plenty of distributions didn't run all that well. Too much
        cruft. It was usable, mind you, but
        still
        quite sluggish.</p>
      <p>Now, I know close to nothing about how Void Linux works. All I can say about it is that it is fast. The fastest
        operating system I have put on this computer. Another breath of fresh air!</p>
      <p>Heck, I could even run KDE Plasma on Void at a reasonable speed. It wasn't great, but it was <em>miles</em>
        better
        than Kubuntu, or any other distribution with Plasma.</p>
      <p>Void Linux with a window manager, or even just XFCE, ran so much better than Plasma. I still find it a bit
        sluggish
        at times, but I tell you, it is not comparable to what macOS ran like.</p>
      <p>Slackware, at least when it came to running the OS, was also pretty fast. That didn't stick with me because of
        the
        situation with installing software. It's fine, it works, but it's slow. Hence, back to Void.</p>
