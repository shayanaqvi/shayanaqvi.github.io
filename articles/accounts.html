      <h1>Accounts</h1>
      <p>Accounts for this, for that, for every single thing. Does your thing even need an account? Who cares! Shove accounts down everyone's throat!</p>
      <p>Quite literally, this is what accounts have become. You need one for everything. Do you need to download a file from a website you're <em>never</em> going to use again for your entire existence? Create an account!</p>
      <p>Mind you, things aren't <em>that</em> bad. Even sites like Youtube still let you use it without an account. We're not far from things getting that bad though. I'm quite sure of it.</p>
