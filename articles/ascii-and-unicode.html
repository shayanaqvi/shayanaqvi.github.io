      <h1>ASCII & Unicode</h1>
      <p>These are essentially character sets that provide codes for each character.</p>
      <h2>ASCII</h2>
      <p>In ASCII-7, there are a total of 128 available characters (codes 0-127) here (2 to the 7th). ASCII-8 provides
        256 available
        characters (2 to the 8th) (codes 0-255).</p>
      <p>Similar characters are grouped together. If A is 65, then B is 66, C is 67, enough said. Upper-case and
        lower-case characters are grouped separately (A is not grouped with a).</p>
      <p>When converting the binary equivalent of the code of a letter, the 6th bit changes. In lower-case letters, the
        6th bit is 1. In upper-case, it's 0.</p>
      <p>ASCIIs main disadvantage is its limited character set. Even ASCII-8 proves to be insufficient. Only so many
        languages and special characters can be supported in 256 slots.</p>
      <p>The purpose of unicode is to allow for a greater number of characters.</p>
      <h2>Unicode</h2>
      <p>The codes of the first 128 characters in unicode are identical to the codes found in ASCII (backwards
        compatible without much fuss).</p>
      <p>16-bit unicode can handle about 65,536 characters (2 to the 16th). 32-bit unicode can handle about 4 billion
        characters.</p>
      <p>With ASCII, characters are referred to with a denary or hexadecimal value. Unicode characters are referred to
        with "U+" followed by a 4 digit hexadecimal number. If 65 is 41 in hexadecimal, then A is referred to as U+0041
        in unicode terminology. These are called code points.</p>
      <p>A few goals of unicode:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a universal standard</li>
        <li>Better coding system for characters (compared to ASCII)</li>
        <li>Uniform number of bits (i.e. 16 bits or 32 bits only (depending on the version of unicode))</li>
        <li>Unambiguous encoding between different versions of unicode (i.e. the same character has the same code in 16
          or 32 bit unicode)</li>
        <li>Reserve part of the code for the user to fill</li>
      </ul>
