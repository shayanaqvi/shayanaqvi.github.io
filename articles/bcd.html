      <h1>BCD</h1>
      <p>The gist of coding decimal values in binary (Binary Coded Decimals) is to write each decimal value as an
        individual
        binary string. For example, 8 would become 1000. 10 would become 0001 and 0000 (1 and then 0). 15 would become
        0001
        and 0101 (1 and then 5). Recall this table:</p>
      <code>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Binary</th>
            <th>Denary</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>0000</th>
            <th>0</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>0001</th>
            <th>1</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>0010</th>
            <th>2</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>0011</th>
            <th>3</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>0100</th>
            <th>4</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>0101</th>
            <th>5</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>0110</th>
            <th>6</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>0111</th>
            <th>7</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>1000</th>
            <th>8</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>1001</th>
            <th>9</th>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </code>
      <p>Note that the maximum value of a BCD string is 9. Above that, you have to split the value into individual
        values and
        convert from there.</p>
      <h2>Storing BCD values.</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Each value goes in individual registers
          <p>If we have 0001 and 0101 (15), we could store these values in individual bytes (or registers for that
            matter (I'm
            using bytes for simplicity's sake)). We end up with 0000001 and 00000101.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Two 4-bit codes are stored in one byte
          <p>If we have a larger value, like 8503, this would be stored in 2 bytes. 8 and 5 goes in one, 0 and 3 go in
            the
            other. We would end up with 10000101 and 00000011.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>BDC Addition and Subtraction</h2>
      <p>This is the same as regular ol' binary addition. The difference in procedure here occurs when your sum is a
        value
        greater than 9.</p>
      <p>Take 8 + 7, or 1000 plus 0111. Let's add these together: 1000 + 0111 = 1111 (15), but in regular binary. In
        BCD, we
        add a
        correction factor of 6 to these sums. So now we do 1111 + 0110 to get 10101, or 00010101 in 8 bits. We can check
        this
        by converting 15 into BCD: 1 becomes 0001 and 5 becomes 0101. Put together, we get 00010101.</p>
