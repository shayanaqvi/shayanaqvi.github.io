      <h1>Trusting Claims of Privacy</h1>
      <p>The deal is this: don't, not by default. You have no reason to trust them automatically.</p>
      <p>Especially if that product is proprietary (i.e. iOS/macOS, Vivaldi), you have NO reason to trust it.</p>
      <p>These companies DO NOT care about you or your privacy. They appear to for sake of marketing. Apple collects
        plenty of telemetry about your usage of their products, and that telemetry is opt-out. They don't ask you
        <em>if</em> they <em>can</em> take your data, they take it anyway.
      </p>
      <p>If you're tempted to believe that a product is private, make sure it is open source. When a product is open
        source, there is a greater incentive for the developers to speak the truth about what their product is and what
        it does. Mind you, being open source does not mean the product cares about your privacy (look at Brave or
        Firefox). But people can audit that software and see what it actually does and does not do.</p>
      <p>As such, do not be tempted to think that anything or anyone cares about your digital privacy. The default
        assumption should be that the product has no regard for your privacy and will collect every little piece of data
        it can.</p>
