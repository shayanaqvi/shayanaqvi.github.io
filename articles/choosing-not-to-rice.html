      <h1>Choosing not to Rice</h1>
      <p>After installing Void Linux again, I made it a point to <em>not</em> rice my desktop, at all. I fell of the
        "ricing"
        train a while ago, but I still bothered with theming QT apps and stuff so everything looked <em>somewhat</em>
        consistent.</p>
      <p>I am so past that now. What's the benefit of not ricing your desktop? You don't care about how it looks! That
        means,
        whenever you run into a rogue app who doesn't respect your system theme, you don't care! That's absolutely
        blissful!
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, you can actually use Flatpak apps without caring one bit about how they look. It doesn't matter
        anymore!
      </p>
      <p>Consistency is, of course, nice. I don't mind it. But achieving it is a task and a half. More effort, now I
        think,
        than is worth.</p>

      <p>There are, of course, usability implications. But chances are that most apps used are of a certain toolkit.
        Most GTK apps will have a similar user experience. You probably know how to use the few QT or EFL apps you do
        use.So for the most part, this is somewhat negligible. It is not, however, ideal.</p>
