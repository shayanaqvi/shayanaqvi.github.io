      <h1>The Equation of a Circle</h1>
      <p>A circle has a radius. On a cartesian plane, this radius becomes the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle, with
        one point lying at the centre of the circle (let's call this \(A(h, k\))), one lying on the circumference of
        the
        circle (let's call this \(B(x, y\))), and one situated at \(C(x, k)\).</p>
      <p>The equation of a circle is essentially the pythagorean theorem applied to this triangle. Using the points we
        defined above, we would get something like \(radius^2=AC^2+BC^2\). This isn't particularly useful. We need the
        magnitude of \(AC\) and \(BC\). This is just the difference between \(x\) and \(h\) for the \(x\) magnitude;
        and the difference between \(y\) and \(k\) for the \(y\) magnitude.</p>
      <p>We end up with \(r^2=(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2\).</p>
      <p>A few things to note about this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>If you set whatever is in either bracket equal to zero, you will get the coordinates of the center of the
          circle. If the coefficient of \(x\), for example, is 1, then you can simply invert the signs. I think you get
          the point.</li>
        <li>If you \(\sqrt{r}\), then you will get the magnitude of the radius.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Let's use \((x-3)^2+(y+4)^2=25\). Using the information above, we know that the center of this circle is
        located at \((3, -4)\) and its radius is 5.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, let's use \((2x-4)^2+(y+8)^2=16\). Here, we know that the center of the circle is located at
        \(2, -8\), and its radius is 4.</p>
      <p>However, we don't always deal with this format. Sometimes we end up with an equation like \(x^2+y^2=1-10x+2y\).
        Really dirty. When bringing this into the proper \((x-h)^2+(y=k)^2=r^2\) format, we always group together any
        like terms on one side and group any other constants on the other.</p>
      <p>\(x^2+y^2=1-10x+2y\) becomes \(x^2+10x+y^2-2y=1\).</p>
      <p>Now, we complete the square for the \(x\) and \(y\) terms individually.</p>
      <p>\((x+5)^2-25+(y-1)^2-1=1\)</p>
      <p>\((x+5)^2+(y-1)^2=27\)</p>
