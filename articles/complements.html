      <h1>Negative Binary Strings</h1>
      <p>Ways to represent binary strings as negative values.</p>
      <p>Part of AS Computer Science, in case you're wondering.</p>
      <h2>One's Complement</h2>
      <p>This is the simple inversion of a binary string. If you have a string of binary digits, like
        <code>01101110</code> or
        whatever, simply invert all digits. If it's a 1, make it a 0. If it's a 0, make it a 1. Applying this to the
        binary
        string above, we would get <code>10010001</code>.
      </p>
      <p>Note that this is not a way to write a negative binary value. It's just something needed for one of the methods
        we'll see below.</p>
      <h2>Two's Complement</h2>
      <p>There are two methods for this.</p>
      <h3>Method 1</h3>
      <p>This method uses one's complement as a stepping stone. If we have a binary string, like <code>10110001</code>,
        we
        first apply one's complement: <code>01001110</code>. Now, we add a singular 1 to this (binary addition). In the
        case
        above, adding a 1 yields <code>01001111</code>.</p>
      <p>Remember, for binary addition with two digits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1+1=10</li>
        <li>0+1=1</li>
        <li>1+0=1</li>
        <li>0+0=0</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the case of 1+1=10, the 1 is carried to the next digit and is added there. This brings us to three digit
        binary
        addition. The rules above still hold true, the only difference is that 1+1+1=11, where the 1 is carried.</p>
      <h3>Method 2</h3>
      <p>This is faster. Up to, and including, the first 1 in our binary string, we leave it as-is. Everything after
        that is
        inverted.</p>
      <p>If we have <code>11001010</code>, we would end up with <code>00110110</code>.</p>
      <p>Remember that we read binary digits from right to left, like Arabic.</p>
      <h2>This doesn't make sense?</h2>
      <p>The deal is with converting back to denary, the numbers need to be converted with the appropriate column
        headings. For base 2, this is 2 to the x power. The left-most heading needs to be negative.</p>
      <p>If, for example, we have <code>01101000</code>, we get a denary value of 104. If we performed the steps
        detailed above, and convert back to denary, we don't get the negative version of that value. Exhibit A:
        <code>10011000</code> does not yeild -104.
      </p>
      <p>For proper conversion, we need to change the left-most heading to be a negative value.</p>
