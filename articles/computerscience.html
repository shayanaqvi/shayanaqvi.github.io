      <h1>I hate computer science</h1>
      <p>Very deep and thoughtful title ikr.</p>
      <p>It's not the concept of the subject, but the subject itself, at the O and A Levels at least.</p>
      <p>The theory portion of this subject frustrates me to no end. It's just thing after thing, fact after fact, term
        after term and it doesn't end! There's just too much content here, all of which is specific to a specific field
        of computer science. What I "learn" under data representation stays there, I can't use any of that stuff
        anywhere else!</p>
      <p>There's one topic of the course that makes me want to cry. It's networking. I struggle for words to describe my
        sheer frustration with this topic. There's just so much here, absolutely zero of which is used elsewhere. I'm
        sure networking can be a captivating topic to study, but not like this!</p>
      <p>With subjects like math, physics or even chemistry (as much as I dislike it), you can understand little and do
        a lot with that. If you understand <em>x</em> topic, you can use that in <em>y</em> topic. With computer
        science? No way!</p>
      <p>Moreover, the textbook is full of so much cruft and needless information (in the context of the actual paper),
        and all of the notes that claim to remove this cruft do not, actually, remove any of it.</p>
      <p>I remember a sentence from the IGCSE textbook of computer science, in the chapter about operating systems if I
        remember correctly, that said <em>something</em> along the lines of "...these are all examples of functions that
        users generally take for granted." WHO ASKED??????????</p>
      <p>I love computers and a lot of technologies in related fields, I find these stuff interesting, but I cannot, for
        the life of me, find any enjoyment in this subject. Anyway, that's enough, isn't it?</p>
