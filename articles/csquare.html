      <h1>A Different Way of Completing the Square</h1>
      <p>I have not used this method enough to say for certain if this has any speed benefits. I did find it interesting
        nonetheless.</p>
      <p>We're familiar with how we solve a quadratic through completing the square the standard way. Take \(x^2+8x-7\):

      <p>The other way is to solve them algebraically. Take a look at the photo below:</p>

      <p>Essentially, we create an equation where our original quadratic equals our desired final form. Then, we bring
        the
        final form into quadratic form, and compare both sides of the equation.</p>
      <p>All is fine and dandy till this point. My problem with this method is this: how do we know our final form? It
        could
        be \((ax+b)^2-r\), or it could be \(a(x+b)^2-r\). Others may exist.</p>
      <p>On these grounds, I think the original method is superior. It's fast, and it works (as long as you know what
        you're
        doing).</p>
      <p>Edit 08/09/2023: this seems obvious in hindsight, but this method works <em>if</em> you know the final form of
        the equation.</p>
