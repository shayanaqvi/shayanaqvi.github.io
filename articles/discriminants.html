      <h1>Discriminants</h1>
      <p>Putting the fancy name aside, a discriminant is the \(b^2-4ac\) in \(\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\) (i.e. the
        quadratic equation).</p>
      <p>It turns out that the value of this expression can tell us about the number of intersections a quadratic
        equation will have with a straight line on a graph.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>if the discriminant > 0, then there are 2 intersections (or solutions, if you will)</li>
        <li>if the discriminant = 0, then there there is 1 solution (i.e. the straight line is a tangent to the curve)
        </li>
        <li>if the discriminant < 0, then there is no solution</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If, for whatever reason, we feel the urge to know how many intersections the line \(y=3x^2-7x+9\) will have
        with \(y=0\) (the \(x\) axis), then we can simply calculate the value of its discriminant.</p>
      <p>if \(a=3, b=-7, c=9\), then the discriminant is \((-7)^2-4(3)(9)\) which yields -59. Looking at the rules
        above, we can satisfy our urge to know the number of intersections this line has with \(y=0\): zero.</p>
      <p>Similarly, we can use this information to find any missing values, or a possible value, in a quadratic if we
        know the number of intersections. Take \(5x^2-3x+k=0\), which supposedly has a tangent that is the \(x\) axis.
        We need the value of \(k\).
      </p>
      <p>We know that for a tangent to exist, our discriminant has to be 0. Hence,</p>
      <p>\((-3)^2-4(5)(k)=0\)</p>
      <p>Solve as normal,</p>
      <p>\(k=\frac{9}{20}\)</p>
      <p>Now, let's find the value of \(k\) if \(x^2+y^2=50\) and \(x=2y+k\) have two points of intersection.</p>
      <p>\(x\) is already the subject in the second equation, so let's put that into the first and solve from there.</p>
      <p>\((2y+k)^2+y^2=50\)</p>
      <p>\(4y^2+4ky+k^2+y^2=50\)</p>
      <p>\(5y^2+4ky+k^2-50=0\) (relate this to \(ax^2+bx+c=0\))</p>
      <p>Now let's work on the discriminant. We know it's greater than zero, since there are two solutions. Hence, we'll
        start working with inequalities.</p>
      <p>\((4k)^2-4(5)(k^2-50)>0\)</p>
      <p>\(16k^2-20k^2+1000>0\)</p>
      <p>\(-4k^2>-1000\)</p>
      <p>\(k^2\gt250\)</p>
      <p>Let \(k^2=250\)</p>
      <p>\(k=\pm5\sqrt{10}\)</p>
      <p>This tells us that \(k\) lies somewhere in between \(-5\sqrt{10}\lt k\lt5\sqrt{10}\).</p>
      <p>That's enough.</p>
