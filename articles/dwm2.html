      <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
      <h3 id="preamble">Preamble</h3>
      <p>There are many better guides on how to do this out on the internet, but the procedure is generally the same.
        The only thing you're going to have to do some research on is the dependencies. Each Linux (or BSD) distribution
        is going to have different package names for each dependency.</p>
      <p>On Void Linux: <code>sudo xbps-install base-devel libX11-devel libXft-devel libXinerama-devel freetype-devel
          fontconfig-devel</code></p>

      <h3 id="source">Acquiring the source code</h3>
      <p>Next, create a directory where you'll store DWMs source code. Clone the repositories there: <code>git clone
          https://git.suckless.org/dwm</code></p>
      <p>dmenu or st aren't requirements, so install those only if you want to.</p>

      <h3 id="building">Building</h3>
      <p>It's pretty simple. Change your current directory to wherever DWM's source code is. In a terminal, type
        <code>make</code>. Then, <code>sudo make clean install</code>. On any subsequent compilations, you can just use
        <code>sudo make install</code>.
      </p>
      <p class="shout">You'll need to build DWM whenever you want to apply any
        tweaks you've made.</p>

      <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
      <p>You've got DWM installed, but before we start it, let's make a quick change to the config file.</p>
      <p>Open up <code>config.h</code> in a text editor. Search for <code>termcmd</code>. This will change the terminal
        that opens up by default. Change it to whatever your preferred terminal emulator is. I have it set as
        <code>xfce4-terminal</code>.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/dwm2-1.png">
      </figure>
      <p>You could, if you wanted to, throw any extra commands in there that you'd like to run whenever you open your
        terminal. We'll get to writing these kinds of commands in a bit.</p>
      <p>While we're here, we might as well change the default modifier key. Out of the box, it's the alt key, which may
        interfere with other apps. We'll change that to the Windows/command key.</p>
      <p>Still in <code>config.h</code>, search for <code>MODKEY</code>.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/dwm2-2.png">
      </figure>
      <p>Change whatever's in there to <code>Mod4Mask</code>. No need to patch or anything.</p>

      <h2 id="first-run">First run</h2>
      <p>You'll see an almost blank screen, save for a bar at the top. The main thing you're going to want to do now is
        open a terminal. You can do this through <code>MODKEY+Shift+Enter</code>.</p>
      <p>We'll start tweaking our configuration file now.</p>

      <h2 id="function-keys">Getting function keys to work</h2>
      <p>Nothing difficult at all!</p>
      <p>At the top of <code>config.h</code>, add this line:
        <code>#include &lt;X11/XF86keysym.h&gt;</code>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/dwm2-3.png">
      </figure>
      <p>The main function keys I need are for brightness, volume and media control. We'll set that up now.</p>
      <p>Keybindings in DWM work as such: you have to define a command first (this happens separately), then you bind
        that command to a key.</p>
      <h3 id="brightness">Brightness</h3>
      <p>Here's how we'll do brightness control. First, you'll have to install a package. It generally goes by the name
        of <code>brightnessctl</code>. If you happen to get permission errors when running the program, you'll need to
        add your current user to the <code>video</code> group. We'll do that as such: <code>usermod -aG video
          $USER</code>. Use root privilages if needed. You may need to reboot.</p>
      <p>Pop these two lines into your <code>config.h</code>.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/dwm2-4.png">
      </figure>
      <p>You can change the name of the commands if you'd like.</p>
      <p>Now we'll bind the relevant keys to these commands. You'll find a section in your configuration file like this:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/dwm2-6.png">
      </figure>
      <p>We'll define our own keybindings at the bottom of this list, underneath this area:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/dwm2-7.png">
      </figure>
      <p>Pop these two lines down:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/dwm2-5.png">
        <figcaption>The leading <code>0</code> is present so that we don't need a modifier key to run these commands.
        </figcaption>
        <figcaption>Make sure you don't forget the comma at the end!</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3 id="volume">Volume</h3>
      <p>I can't say for sure if this works with Pipewire. I happen to use Pulseaudio on my machine, and I do know that
        these commands work here. Under the commands section of your configuration file:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/dwm2-8.png">
      </figure>
      <p>Then, wherever your keybindings are:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/dwm2-9.png">
      </figure>

      <h3 id="media">Media keys</h3>
      <p>There are a few ways you could go about this.</p>
      <h4 id="mpd">Are you a user of MPD?</h4>
      <p class="shout">If you don't know what MPD is, don't worry! Move on to the next
        section.</p>
      <p>If you are, you have two options. If you're like me and just want your media keys to do nothing but play/pause
        audio from MPD, then we'll do the following.</p>
      <p>Firstly, install <code>mpc</code>. The commands we'll use are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>mpc toggle</code></li>
        <li><code>mpc next</code></li>
        <li><code>mpc prev</code></li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/dwm2-10.png">
      </figure>
      <p>Then:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/dwm2-11.png">
      </figure>
      <p class="shout">Alternatively, if you'd like to be able to control all of
        your
        media
        through the media keys, including MPD, then you'll need a
        package generally named something along the lines of <code>mpDris</code>. Install that, then we'll set it up
        in
        the next section.</p>

      <h4 id="non-mpd">Are you not a user of MPD?</h4>
      <p>Install a package, generally named <code>playerctl</code>. We'll use the following commands:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>playerctl play-pause</code></li>
        <li><code>playerctl next</code></li>
        <li><code>playerctl previous</code></li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/dwm2-12.png">
      </figure>
      <p>Then:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/dwm2-11.png">
      </figure>
      <p>That's function keys set up.</p>
      <p>If you want a list of the names of all of the function keys, <a
          href="https://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/XF86_keyboard_symbols" , target="_blank">XF86 keyboard
          symbols</a>.</p>
      <p>If you'd like to figure out the name of a specific key, install <code>xev</code>. Run that from a terminal, and
        check the output. You're going to have to do some digging to find the name of the currently pressed key in the
        output.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/dwm2-13.png">
      </figure>
      <p>Be careful though! Moving your mouse is also going to register in this program.</p>

      <h3 id="chain">Chaining commands to a single key</h3>
      <p>If you want to chain multiple commands to a single key, you can simply define individual commands for the
        things you'd like to do, then bind both of those commands to the same key. Here's an example:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/dwm2-14.png">
        <figcaption>This will lock the screen and set the backlight to zero</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2 id="autostart">Autostart</h2>
      <h3 id="disp-1">Do you use a display manager?</h3>
      <p>Plop your startup instructions in <code>~/.xprofile</code>. Keep reading!</p>
      <h3 id="non-disp-1">Do you not use a display manager?</h3>
      <p>Plop your startup instructions in <code>~/.xinitrc</code>.</p>
      <div class="shout">
        <h3 style="padding: 0; margin: 0;">Plopping your startup instructions</h3>
        <p>It's the same procedure for both. You can literally just list a bunch of shell commands. Here's mine:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./media/dwm2-15.png">
        </figure>
        <p style="margin: 0;">Ensure your <code>.xprofile</code> or <code>.xinitrc</code> is executable!</p>
      </div>

      <h2 id="starting">Starting DWM</h2>
      <h3 id="disp-2">Do you use a display manager?</h3>
      <p>You'll need to create a file. Let's call it <code>dwm.desktop</code>. Put the following content in it:</p>
      <code>[Desktop Entry]</code><br>
      <code>Encoding=UTF-8</code><br>
      <code>Name=DWM</code><br>
      <code>Comment=Dynamic Window Manager</code><br>
      <code>Exec=/usr/local/bin/dwm</code><br>
      <code>Icon=dwm</code><br>
      <code>Type=XSession</code>
      <p>Place this file in <code>/usr/share/xsessions</code>. Then select DWM from your display manager.</p>

      <h3 id="non-disp-2">Do you not use a display manager?</h3>
      <p>We'll put this in <code>~/.xinitrc</code>:</p>
      <code>exec /usr/local/bin/dwm</code>
      <p>Then, whenever you login to your TTY, simply type <code>startx</code>. Beware that commands placed after this
        line will <strong>not</strong> run, think of this as the EOF of your <code>.xinitrc</code>.</p>

      <h2 id="dbus">DBUS</h2>
      <p>If you're having issues with DBUS on DWM specifically, such as apps not starting or MRPIS not working, then
        there's probably something to do with DBUS.</p>
      <p>I had this issue, and this is how I solved it. Since I don't use a display manager, I just put the following
        into <code>~/.xinitrc</code>:</p>
      <code>exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session /usr/local/bin/dwm</code>
      <p>I suspect you could do the same in your <code>dwm.desktop</code> file, but I am not sure.</p>


      <h2 id="status">Status bar</h2>
      <p>I'm going to ask you something: do you really need to use Polybar? I'm also going to answer this question for
        you: no you don't! Use the built-in status bar! It can go a long way with some creative formatting.</p>
      <p>Firstly, install <code>xsetroot</code>.</p>
      <p>We'll set up a loop in your <code>.xinitrc</code> or <code>.xprofile</code>. This is my loop as of now:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/dwm2-16.png">
      </figure>
      <p>As you can see, this is just a bunch of shell commands, with some manual formatting. This code produces a
        status bar as such:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/dwm2-17.png">
      </figure>
      <p>Essentially, you'll be using <code>xsetroot -name</code> and then insert your commands inside a single string.
        Wrap each command with <code>$()</code>. For example, <code>$(date)</code>. String together multiple commands
        like these,
        be creative with your formatting, and you'll get a status bar as good as Polybar. You can even have icons by
        using unicode iconography!</p>

      <h2 id="misc">Miscellaneous</h2>
      <h3 id="lock">Locking your screen</h3>
      <p>There's a bajillion ways you could do this, but I do it through <code>i3lock</code>. The command I use to lock
        my screen is as such: <code>i3lock --color=000000</code>.</p>
      <h3 id="wallpaper">Wallpapers</h3>
      <p>You can install <code>nitrogen</code>. Point it to wherever your wallpapers are, and you can set them from
        there.</p>
      <h3 id="composite">Compositing/screen tearing</h3>
      <p>I'm gonna hand you over to the internet here, I do not have much experience here.</p>
      <h3 id="swap">Swapping caps-lock and control</h3>
      <p>This isn't remotely related to DWM but it's such a nice quality of life improvement, especially with window
        managers.</p>
      <p>You can do this through this command: <code>/usr/bin/setxkbmap -option "ctrl:swapcaps"</code>. Now, your caps
        lock key will act as control, and control will act as caps lock.</p>

      <h2 id="patch">Do you need to patch DWM?</h2>
      <p>Resounding no unless there's actually something you need. Patching DWM is a very messy process, so save
        yourself the pain by not doing that. If you find yourself needing many patches (perfectly reasonable), you're
        probably better off using another window manager. That'll give you a much better experience! Window managers
        such as Qtile or i3 are also great!</p>

      <h2 id="addendum">Addendum</h2>
      <p>I've tried to cover most of the things I dealt with when I started with DWM, but inevitably, there are going to
        be missing things. The internet is your best friend! The ArchWiki too!</p>
