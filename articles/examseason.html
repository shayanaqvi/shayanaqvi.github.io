      <h1>Reflecting on Exam Season & Future Plans (The Situation III)</h1>
      <p>All in all, considering the circumstances, midterms went well enough. I can't speak for the results since I don't have them, but based off of how I feel they went, there's one glaring issue with all of my subjects: a lack of practice. With regard to content, I feel like I have everything under control. With regard to papers, I don't. Exam questions at this level are a different breed entirely, especially with chemistry and physics.</p>
      <p>Plans for the near future? At this point, it's practice. Then comes keeping up with whatever new content we do next term. I was rather neglectful of a few subjects this term, and though I was able to cope up well enough (from what I think), the situation wasn't ideal. Given this, we have two things that need to be done from next term onwards: regular revision and practice. There's no way around that.</p>
      <p>The situation? Net positive. Math is good, computer science is good, physics is good, chemistry is good. Such is the situation.</p>
