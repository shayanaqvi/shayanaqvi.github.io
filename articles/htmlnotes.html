      <h1>Taking Notes in HTML</h1>
      <p>This is not something I do because I don't have a system for taking notes. I don't want to use any apps, but
        using a simple folder-file directory structure is a bit hard to maintain. It needs some time, I don't want to
        force myself to use anything.</p>
      <p>However, in situations where I would usually find myself using markdown, I now find myself using HTML. Markdown
        is great, but there's something about HTML I like more. I don't know what that is.</p>
      <p>Mind you, writing tags in HTML is a big problem UNLESS you have a good LSP. In Helix, this exists, and while
        it's not amazing, it gets the job done just well enough to not frustrate me.</p>
