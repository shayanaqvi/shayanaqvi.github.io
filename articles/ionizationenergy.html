      <h1>Ionization Energy</h1>
      <h2>Defining Ionization Energy</h2>
      <h3>The First I.E.</h3>
      <p>The energy required to remove 1 mole of electrons from 1 mole of gaseous atoms to form 1 mole of gaseous 1+
        ions.</p>
      <h3>The Second I.E.</h3>
      <p>The energy required to remove 1 mole of electrons from 1 mole of gaseous 1+ ions to form 1 mole of gaseous 2+
        ions.</p>
      <p>So on and so forth for the definitions of every other ionization energy.</p>

      <h2>Factors affecting Ionization Energies</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>The nuclear charge/number of protons</h3>
          <p>A larger number of protons yields a higher ionization energy since the attraction between protons and
            electrons is stronger.</p>
          <p>Something else to note is that the nuclear charge increases for every successive ionization energy (i.e.
            the 3rd ionization energy deals with a higher nuclear charge than the 1st). Again, there are less electrons
            at this stage, so the attraction between protons and electrons will be stronger, resulting in a greater
            required ionization energy to remove electrons.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Atomic radius/distance from the nucleus</h3>
          <p>As you move away from the nucleus, the attraction between protons and electrons weakens. Hence, a greater
            atomic radius results in less required ionization energy. Inverse proportion.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Shielding/the number of inner shells</h3>
          <p>Inner shells are more attracted to the nucleus than outer shells. Hence, the more inner shells you have,
            the weaker the attraction is between the nucleus and the outer shells. The outer shells are "shielded" from
            the attraction of the nucleus, so to speak. More shielding results in less required ionization energy.
            Inverse proportion.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Stable configurations</h3>
          <p>Greater ionization energy is required to remove electrons from fully or half-filled orbitals.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Trends</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>As you move down a group, the ionization energy will <em>decrease</em>.
          <ul>
            <li>The size of the atom will increase, resulting in greater shielding and atomic radius.</li>
            <li>The effect of the shielding counteracts the effect of the increased nuclear charge.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>As you move across a period, the ionization energy will <em>increase</em>. This is <em>generally</em> true.
          <ul>
            <li>The nuclear charge increases, but the size of the atom remains similar. This results in a stronger
              attraction and hence a greater required ionization energy.</li>
            <li>The change in shielding is negligible, since the number of shells remains constant.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Dips in Ionization Energy</h3>
      <p>Looking at a graph of the ionization energies of period 3, we can see that the ionization energies of aluminium
        and sulfur are less than the elements before them.</p>
      <p>In the case of aluminium, a new subshell of the same energy level as magnesium is introduced. Since this new
        subshell is further away from the nucleus (more shielded), less ionization energy is required (Mg ends with a
        3s^2 subshell, Al ends with a 3p^1 subshell). In more general terms, the outermost electron of Al is more
        shielded than Mg.</p>
      <p>In the case of sulfur, we have a newly filled orbital. Since we're dealing with a 3p^4 subshell, one of the
        orbitals is full and the other two are half-full. In the full orbital, both electrons experience repulsion
        towards each other, resulting in it being easier to remove an electron from that orbital. Phosphorus deals with
        3p^3, in which all orbitals are half-full. This repulsion doesn't exist there. Hence, a lesser
        ionization energy for sulfur.</p>
      <p>These hold true for the rest of the periods. There exists a dip in ionization for oxygen too, but the reasoning
        remains the same.</p>
