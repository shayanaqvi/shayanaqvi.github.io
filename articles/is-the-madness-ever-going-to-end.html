          the madness ever going to end?</a></p>
      <em>
        <p>
          “There is something seriously wrong with the IT industry. It’s so bad
          that I haven’t managed to find a single industry with the same massive
          amount of stupidity, with the exception of perhaps the fashion industry.
          It’s like the IT industry has been paralyzed in some strange kind of
          mass hypnosis.</p>
        <p>No, I will not be polite and call it something else because it is
          truly sheer stupidity.</p>
        <p>In the past IT people, whether we’re talking about programmers or
          something else, were very clever people. People with a high level of
          intelligence that took serious pride in doing things in a meaningful and
          pragmatic way.</p>
        <p>In the so-called modern day it’s like everyone - except a few - has
          dropped their brain on the floor. They keep inventing “revolutionary new
          ways” of doing the same thing that could be done in a dozen ways
          already. And they do that by coating more and more and more unnecessary
          complexity on top of existing technology stacks.</p>
        <p>Electron and React Native Desktop are supposed to be a revolutionary
          new way of making desktop applications. Except they are not, and they
          eat up all the memory you have and still ask for more. They constantly
          crash and have no value over a native desktop application what so ever -
          well, perhaps with the only exception that now a 2 year old baby can
          make something shiny that you can click on with your mouse.</p>
        <p>But, noooo, you’re a dinosaur, you don’t understand anything, it’s
          the future, it’s the modern way of doing things. Native desktop apps are
          dead!</p>
        <p>PHP is a programming language mainly for web development. It is made
          in C, a pure procedural language, originally as a templating language,
          and it still is a templating language at the core, yet it is apparently
          not good enough. We have to put a completely different template system
          on top of PHP, also written in PHP, which now makes the application load
          four times as slow.</p>
        <p>But, noooo, you’re a dinosaur, you don’t understand anything, it’s
          the future, it’s the modern way of doing things. We don’t do that in
          modern web development any more!</p>
        <p>All web servers have a built-in router. Whether it’s NGINX, Apache,
          lighttpd, Caddy or something else. But no. Let’s not use that; let’s add
          yet another router on top of that with a single entry point and then
          basically re-write every single request before it gets served.</p>
        <p>But, noooo, you’re a dinosaur, you don’t understand anything, it’s
          the future, it’s the modern way of doing things. We don’t do that in
          modern web development any more!</p>
        <p>The browser’s native language is HTML. HTML is a markup language and
          if you feed HTML to the browser it will quickly render the page with
          what you give it. But no. Let’s not do that. Let’s instead feed the
          browser with JSON and then have the built-in JavaScript engine translate
          that into a pre-formatted output which then gets translated into HTML
          before it’s served to the user. Oh, and while we’re at it, let’s do the
          same thing with CSS. So, now your simple news article or blog post takes
          ages to load on a 1 gigabit connection and requires about 3 times as
          much electrical power even though you’re only serving text and perhaps a
          few images - just because someone thought it was a really good idea to
          make a React app instead of a simple HTML page rendered by the
          server.</p>
        <p>Why in the world has this idiotic trend of abstracting everything
          away by layers upon layers of complexity gained such a strong foothold
          in the industry? Has everyone except the “unix greybeards” gone
          mad!?</p>
        <p>The situation is really bad for the industry. And it is a real shame
          that the younger generations who grow up not knowing anything else,
          thinking that these so-called “modern ways of doing things” are the
          correct and best ways, will have to suffer when everything starts to
          crumble (which it already is).</p>
        <p>The entry barrier to programming needs to be high! Programming is
          engineering; it’s not something where you throw stuff at the wall and
          see what sticks and just assume that programming languages, browsers,
          and operating systems are made of magical dust.”</p>
