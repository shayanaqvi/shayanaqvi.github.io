      <h1>Networking</h1>
      <p>This is a very dense topic; there's just so much here. Try searching (Ctrl+f) if you want to find something
        specific. Information on everything here is probably not complete.</p>
      <h2>Defining a network</h2>
      <p>A connection between two or more computer systems which are capable of sharing hardware and software resources;
        this connection may be wired or wireless.</p>
      <h2>WANs</h2>
      <p>A network that covers a wide area (Wide Area Network). These are used when computers situated far away from
        each other need to connect to each other. A connected number of LANs can form a WAN.</p>
      <p>A WAN consists of two kinds of systems: end systems and intermediate systems. An end system is a computer that
        does not extend the network (the network "ends" at that computer). An intermediate system can extend the network
        to other computers.</p>
      <h3>Characteristics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Can be used by an organization to connect branches</li>
        <li>Not centrally owned</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Usually leased from a PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) company</li>
          <li>A dedicated communication channel is provided</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Generally runs on fiber-optic cables</li>
        <li>Switches are used to relay data</li>
        <li>End systems are generally not directly connected to the WAN (they exist in LANs)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>LANs</h2>
      <p>A LAN is akin to a small, private network. Hence the name, Local Area Network. It will usually contain a number
        of systems connected to hubs or switches. Routers and/or modems allow LANs to connect to WANs.</p>
      <h3>Characteristics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Local sharing of resources</li>
        <li>Used within a specific site</li>
        <li>Owned by whoever sets up the LAN</li>
        <li>Twisted-pair cables or wireless networking are generally used</li>
        <li>End systems are present in a LAN</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>WLANs</h3>
      <p>This is simply a wireless LAN. Signals are provided using radio or infrared waves. Generally works over smaller
        distances, up to about 100m.</p>
      <h2>Comparing the sizes of different kinds of networks</h2>

      <h2>Internet</h2>
      <p>This term is used to describes a number of interconnected networks (internetwork, shortened to internet).</p>

      <h2>Models</h2>
      <p>Ways to create a network.</p>
      <h3>Client-Server</h3>
      <p>Computers are connected to a centralized server. The computer from which connection requests are made is the
        client, the computer that receives these requests is the server. A few more things to note:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A server may act as a remote storage medium for all connected computers to access</li>
        <li>File permissions are used extensively (who can access what) (security)</li>
        <li>Central security databases are used, that control access to shared resources</li>
        <li>Easy to scale</li>
        <li>Backups are easy to make and maintain</li>
        <li>The performance of the server may be throttled if it receives more requests than it can handle</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Peer to Peer</h3>
      <p>Each computer in a peer to peer network is called a node. These nodes are all connected to each other (hence
        the name). It is decentralized.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each node stores its own data</li>
        <li>Data is accessed from other nodes</li>
        <li>Peers can both supply and consume data to and from other computers respectively</li>
        <li>All computers have the same responsibilities</li>
        <li>Security is handled by each individual node</li>
        <li>Difficult to manage when scaled</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Advantages of either model</h3>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>P2P</th>
          <th>Client-Server</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Less congestion</td>
          <td>Better security</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Parts of a file may be downloaded from different nodes</td>
          <td>Better protection from malware, since files are stored in one (central) location</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Files available from multiple hosts</td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h2>Client types</h2>
      <h3>Thin clients</h3>
      <p>A thin client needs to be connected to a more powerful machine for it to be able to process data. It has little
        horsepower on its own and thus can do little on its own. This can be both hardware (i.e. a POS terminal) and
        software (i.e. a web browser).</p>
      <h4>Advantages/disadvantages</h4>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Advantages</th>
          <th>Disadvantages</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Less costly to scale (since low-cost devices can be used)</td>
          <td>High reliance on a centralized server (if it goes down, a thin client isn't very useful)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Data/software updates from a central source (greater control over the client)</td>
          <td>More expensive initially, to set up</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Better protection against malware (the server can handle this instead of the client)</td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Thick clients</h3>
      <p>This kind of client can work online or offline; it doesn't have a high reliance on a server. This can also be
        hardware (i.e. regular ol' computer) or software (i.e. text editors).</p>
      <h4>Advantages/disadvantages</h4>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Advantages</th>
          <th>Disadvantages</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Offline data processing</td>
          <td>Less secure (security depends on the client)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>More control/autonomy given to the client</td>
          <td>Data/software updates are handled individually</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Less reliance on a server</td>
          <td>Worse data integrity relative to other similar devices</td>

          <td>Constant reliance on server</td>
          <td>Less reliance on server (can work reasonable well without a network connection)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Few hardware resources required (less memory, storage, processing power, etc.)</td>
          <td>Heavy reliance on local resources</td>
        </tr>

      </ul>
      <h2>Requirements to establish a network</h2>
      <p>5 things are required for a network:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a sender</li>
        <li>a receiver</li>
        <li>a transmission medium</li>
        <li>a message</li>
        <li>a protocol (set of rules)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Modes of transmission</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Simplex</h3>
          <p>Data goes one way only (i.e. data transmission from a keybord to CPU, data being sent from a computer,
            radio/television stations)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Half-Duplex</h3>
          <p>Data goes two ways, but not at the same time (i.e. walkie-talkies)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Full-Duplex / Duplex</h3>
          <p>Data goes two ways, at the same time (i.e. broadband connection on a phone line, telephones)</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Types of messages</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Unicast message</h3>
          <p>A message is sent from one point to another (1:1) (think of text messaging).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Multicast</h3>
          <p>A message is sent to a specified group of devices (think of group messaging or email lists).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Broadcast</h3>
          <p>A message is sent to anyone and everyone. If you want to receive it, you can.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Network topologies</h2>
      <h3>Point-to-point connection</h3>
      <p>This topology connects one computer directly to another. Messages are sent as unicast messages. Simplex and
        duplex transmission may be supported. Difficult to scale</p>
      <h3>Bus topology</h3>
      <p>Computers are connected to a central link. There are no direct connections to any computers here. Messages need
        to be broadcast, even if they are intended for a specific system.</p>
      <p>These are easy to scale, and is not reliant on the status/situation of any individual node (i.e. if a node
        dies, the network still works). However, if the main cable dies, then the network goes down. It suffers from
        bottlenecking and lacks security since packets pass through multiple nodes.</p>
      <h4>Transmitting packets in a bus topology</h4>
      <p>Each node looks at the packet and detemines whether or not the recipient of the packet corresponds to the
        address of the node. If it matches, it's not sent forward. The opposite is also true.</p>
      <p>Terminators exist at each end of the central cable. If nobody receives the packet, it is terminated here.</p>
      <h3>Mesh topology</h3>
      <p>Each system is individually connected to every other system in the network. Messages have the leverage of being
        one of unicast, multicast or broadcast. Duplex transmission works here.</p>
      <p>A lot of cabling is needed, however, which proves costly and makes maintenance difficult. Conversely,
        identifying faults in the network is relatively easy, broken links do not affect the rest of the network, and
        scaling the network is somewhat easier.</p>
      <h3>Star topology</h3>
      <p>Each system is connected to a central server (think client-server model). Duplex transmission works here, and
        messages may be unicast, multicast or broadcast. The central device may be a hub or switch. This is the most
        common way of setting up a network.</p>
      <p>If an end system fails, then the rest of the network can function normally. Security is also better, since
        packets are received by a specified computer. However, if the central server fails, then the entire network goes
        down. Installation costs - intially - are high.</p>
      <h3>Hybrid topology</h3>
      <p>A combination of two or more topologies. These can offer great control over the network, but are complex to
        install, configure and maintain.</p>

      <h2>Transmission media</h2>
      <h3>Cables</h3>
      <h4>Twisted-pair cables</h4>
      <p>This kind of cable has the lowest data transfer rate and suffers from external interference (i.e. E.M.
        radiation). It is affordable, however. These can be purchased as unshielded cables (as the name implies) or
        shielded (which contains a thin layer of metal foil to reduce external interference).</p>
      <h4>Coaxial cables</h4>
      <p>These cost more than twisted-pair cables, but have better transfer rates and are less susceptible to external
        interference. These have about 80 times the transmission capacity of twisted-pair cables. Generally not used for
        long-distance telephone cabling.</p>
      <h4>Fibre optic cables</h4>
      <p>Most commonly used to send data over long distances, since they offer the best transfer rates, have great
        signal strength and are least affected by external interference. These have about 26,000 times the transmission
        capacity of twisted-pair cables. They cost much, however, and are not as easy to maintain as other types of
        cables. Data is transmitted in the form of light.</p>
      <h5>Types</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Single-core (or single-mode): uses a single light source to transmit data, which results in less reflection
          as the light travels through the cable. It allows for a better transmission rate and distance.</li>
        <li>Multi-core (or multi-mode): uses multiple light sources, resulting in more reflection. They work better over
          shorter distances.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Comparison</h4>

      <h4>Factors that cause poor performance of cables</h4>
      <p>Susceptibility to interferance & extent of attenuation at high frequencies.</p>

      <h3>Wireless data transmission</h3>
      <p>Data transmission through electromagnetic radiation (radio/microwave/infrared).</p>
      <p>A few things to note:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Penetration</h4>
          <p>This refers to the ability of EM radiation to pass through different media (i.e. walls). Radio waves have
            the best penetration power, followed by microwaves and then infrared.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Attenuation</h4>
          <p>This refers to the deterioration of signal strength (i.e. reduction in amplitude). Infrared has the highest
            attenuation of the three waves, since it can be affected by rain or walls.</p>
          <p>High attenuation can be advantageous however. In the case of infrared waves, it proves superior for indoor
            use. Its low attenuation means any emitted infrared signals have a low chance of interfering with each
            other.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Bandwidth</h4>
          <p>A measure of the amount of data that can be transmitted per second.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Wired vs. wireless</h3>
      <h4>Wired</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Better stability and reliability</li>
        <li>Faster data transfer rates</li>
        <li>Cheaper, as compared to wireless networks</li>
        <li>Worse portability</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Wireless</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Easier to scale networks</li>
        <li>Better portability</li>
        <li>Increased vulnerability to external interference/tapping</li>
        <li>Worse security</li>
        <li>Variable stability and transfer rates</li>
        <li>Signal strength may be affected by things such as walls</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>WiFi and Bluetooth</h3>
      <p>Both offer wireless communication between devices are use electromagnetic radiation for this purpose.</p>
      <h4>Bluetooth</h4>
      <p>79 channels (or different frequencies) are available for connection. When a device is paired, it will use one
        of these 79 channels (randomly). If a channel is in use, another will be selected. This technology is known as
        <em>spread spectrum frequency hopping</em>.
      </p>
      <h4>WiFi</h4>
      <p>This also makes use of spread spectrum frequency hopping technology. It is better suited for full-scale
        networks since it offers better data trasnfer rates, range and security as compared to bluetooth. The internet
        can be accessed through WiFi by a WAP (Wireless Access Point) up to 100m away.</p>

      <h2>Satellites</h2>
      <h3>Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites</h3>
      <p>These are located at the highest altitude as compared to the rest of the satellites mentioned in this
        document.
        They are used to provide long-distance telephone and computer network communication. Only three are needed for
        global coverage. The word "Geostationary" refers to the fact that the satellite remains in the same place
        relative to the earth during orbit (i.e. it orbits at the same speed as the earth spins).</p>
      <h3>Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites</h3>
      <p>These are a bit closer to the earth. They are used for GPS. 10 are needed for global coverage.</p>
      <h3>Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites</h3>
      <p>Closest to the earth, and are generally used to supplement mobile phone networks. 50 are required for global
        coverage, but several hundred are currently in orbit.</p>
      <h3>Other information</h3>
      <p>Satellites can act as a part of a network, and can connected directly to other ground-based parts of a
        network.
        It does come with its own problems - namely delays, due to the distance, and difficulty when it comes to
        maintenance.</p>


      <h2>Hardware definitions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Hub</h3>
          <p>A hub is a non-intelligent device that forwards any data packets (or simply "packets") it receives to
            <em>all</em> connected computers.
          </p>
          <p>Hubs lack security and are wasteful of bandwidth. They can be wired or wireless.</p>
          <p>They are generally not used nowadays.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Switch</h3>
          <p>A switch is an intelligent device that forwards any received data packets to a specific computer (i.e. a
            hub that does not automatically forward anything it receives to all computers in a network).</p>
          <p>They offer better security, and are more resourceful of bandwidth.</p>
          <p>Each device a network will have a MAC (Media Access Control) address. It uniquely identifies it. A switch
            will use these addresses to determine who is sending the packet and who is receiving it.</p>
          <p>These can be wired or wireless.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Repeater</h3>
          <p>A repeater aims to undo any loss of signal strength (attenuation). They essentially amplify both analogue
            (i.e. received from copper cables) and digital signals (i.e. received from fibre optic cables).</p>
          <p>They can be used when sending data over long distances, or to simply provide better coverage for wireless
            networks (think of WiFi repeaters).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Bridge</h3>
          <p>A bridge will interconnect LANs. These LANs must use the same protocol (i.e. they must be wired or wireless
            only, not both). These can be wired or wireless.</p>
        </li>

          <h3>Router</h3>
          <p>A router determines a route for packets to travel from one network to another (i.e. from a LAN to a WAN).
            Routers do not require a homogenous protocol between networks; it can translate protocols as needed, to
            allow for communication.</p>
          <p>Routers can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>restrict broadcasts to within a LAN</li>
            <li>act as a gateway (more on this below)</li>
            <li>translate protocols (to allow them to communicate with each other)</li>
            <li>transfer data between networks</li>
            <li>determine efficient routes for data to travel to its destination</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Gateway</h3>
          <p>A gateway is essentially an access point to another network (think of the gate to your home, or door to
            your flat). They can be used to connect dissimilar LANs, and may translate protocols as needed. They can act
            as routers, firewalls and servers. Wired and wireless versions exist.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Modem</h3>
          <p>This is essentially an ADC (modulator) and a DAC (demodulator) in one device. The name is derived from
            the
            words "modulator" and "demodulator".</p>
          <p>Wireless modems also exist.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Network Interface Card (NIC)</h3>
          <p>This is needed to allow a device to connect to a network. Generally part of device hardware and contains
            the MAC address of the device.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Wireless Network Interface Card (WNIC)</h3>
          <p>The same as an NIC, but wireless. They use an antenna to communicate with networks (through microwaves (not
            the kitchen appliance)). They can plug into the USB port of a computer, or can be integrated in the main
            board.</p>
