      <h1>Is the Madness Ever Going to End?</h1>
      <p>This is an excerpt from: <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/is-the-madness-ever-going-to-end.html">Is
          the madness ever going to end?</a></p>
      <p>
        “There is something seriously wrong with the IT industry. It’s so bad
        that I haven’t managed to find a single industry with the same massive
        amount of stupidity, with the exception of perhaps the fashion industry.
        It’s like the IT industry has been paralyzed in some strange kind of
        mass hypnosis.</p>
      <p>No, I will not be polite and call it something else because it is
        truly sheer stupidity.</p>
      <p>In the past IT people, whether we’re talking about programmers or
        something else, were very clever people. People with a high level of
        intelligence that took serious pride in doing things in a meaningful and
        pragmatic way.</p>
      <p>In the so-called modern day it’s like everyone - except a few - has
        dropped their brain on the floor. They keep inventing “revolutionary new
        ways” of doing the same thing that could be done in a dozen ways
        already. And they do that by coating more and more and more unnecessary
        complexity on top of existing technology stacks.</p>
      <p>Electron and React Native Desktop are supposed to be a revolutionary
        new way of making desktop applications. Except they are not, and they
        eat up all the memory you have and still ask for more. They constantly
        crash and have no value over a native desktop application what so ever -
        well, perhaps with the only exception that now a 2 year old baby can
        make something shiny that you can click on with your mouse.</p>
      <p>But, noooo, you’re a dinosaur, you don’t understand anything, it’s
        the future, it’s the modern way of doing things. Native desktop apps are
        dead!</p>
      <p>PHP is a programming language mainly for web development. It is made
        in C, a pure procedural language, originally as a templating language,
        and it still is a templating language at the core, yet it is apparently
        not good enough. We have to put a completely different template system
        on top of PHP, also written in PHP, which now makes the application load
        four times as slow.</p>
      <p>But, noooo, you’re a dinosaur, you don’t understand anything, it’s
        the future, it’s the modern way of doing things. We don’t do that in
        modern web development any more!</p>
      <p>All web servers have a built-in router. Whether it’s NGINX, Apache,
        lighttpd, Caddy or something else. But no. Let’s not use that; let’s add
        yet another router on top of that with a single entry point and then
        basically re-write every single request before it gets served.</p>
      <p>But, noooo, you’re a dinosaur, you don’t understand anything, it’s
        the future, it’s the modern way of doing things. We don’t do that in
        modern web development any more!</p>
      <p>The browser’s native language is HTML. HTML is a markup language and
        if you feed HTML to the browser it will quickly render the page with
        what you give it. But no. Let’s not do that. Let’s instead feed the
        browser with JSON and then have the built-in JavaScript engine translate
        that into a pre-formatted output which then gets translated into HTML
        before it’s served to the user. Oh, and while we’re at it, let’s do the
        same thing with CSS. So, now your simple news article or blog post takes
        ages to load on a 1 gigabit connection and requires about 3 times as
        much electrical power even though you’re only serving text and perhaps a
        few images - just because someone thought it was a really good idea to
        make a React app instead of a simple HTML page rendered by the
        server.</p>
      <p>Why in the world has this idiotic trend of abstracting everything
        away by layers upon layers of complexity gained such a strong foothold
        in the industry? Has everyone except the “unix greybeards” gone
        mad!?</p>
      <p>The situation is really bad for the industry. And it is a real shame
        that the younger generations who grow up not knowing anything else,
        thinking that these so-called “modern ways of doing things” are the
        correct and best ways, will have to suffer when everything starts to
        crumble (which it already is).</p>
      <p>The entry barrier to programming needs to be high! Programming is
        engineering; it’s not something where you throw stuff at the wall and
        see what sticks and just assume that programming languages, browsers,
        and operating systems are made of magical dust.”</p>
