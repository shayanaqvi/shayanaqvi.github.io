      <p>The prompt for this article: <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/ubisoft-plus-subscription-exec-gamers-need-to-get-comfortable-with-not-owning-your-games/">https://www.thegamer.com/ubisoft-plus-subscription-exec-gamers-need-to-get-comfortable-with-not-owning-your-games/</a></p>
      <p>This is just wrong. There's a point to be made that plenty of people do not replay games they have completed. For that kind of consumer, this may be fine. But I don't think this is a good route to go down.</p>
      <p>It's the whole not owning things you pay for. In the context of a subscription, that's fine. Xbox Gamepass is fine. It serves a specific customer. But to make that the standard of acquiring games is not something I'm particularly fond of. Game preservation, too much control to the company, yada yada yada so on and so forth.</p>
      <p>Can we not do this?</p>
