			<h1>Waiting for Animations</h1>
			<p>Note: This article concerns the use of animations in interface designs.</p>
			<p>The point is, I don't want to wait for your animations!</p>
			<p>They slow down the experience. Waiting for a paragraph to bounce into frame, or images to slide into the
				viewport are
				things that slow down the navigation of the site. The problem is having to <em>wait</em> for them to happen.
				These
				kinds of animations <em>can be</em> nice, but only when you <em>don't</em> have to wait for them!</p>
			<p>I'm here to see the content of your site, not your site's blingy animations! Make them faster, or remove them
				entirely! If I have to wait, at all, to see the contents of a paragraph <em>because</em> your fancy animation
				wants to
				act like a special snowflake, then a bad impression follows without saying.</p>
			<p>You have two options: ðŸ”« make them fast, or get rid of them.</p>

				with them. Have a nice day!</p>
