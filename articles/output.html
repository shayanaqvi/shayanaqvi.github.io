      <h1>October's Output</h1>
      <p>Definitely not great. Literally 1 article.</p>
      <p>You see, part of my problem is simply not knowing what to write about. There are a bunch of things I could
        write about, but my thoughts on those things aren't particularly complete <em>or</em> I'm not willing to put the
        effort into completing them. Hence, we may conclude that my problem is a lack of effort, from which we can infer
        a lack of interest, perhaps.</p>
      <p>I can only write about what I'm doing for so long! Especially given that I'm not doing much nowadays other than
        studying (and work for an event at school but I'll get to that later).</p>
      <p>If <em>n</em> denotes the number of articles written in a particular month, you see, then the value of
        <em>n</em> for this month should be greater than 3. Thus, we can conclude that in order for n to be greater than
        3, more than 3 articles need to be written this month.
      </p>
      <p>So the goal of the number of things I put on this site this month should be greater than 3, i.e. 3 articles
        other than this.</p>
