      <h1>Photoshop is not Graphic Design!</h1>
      <p>Something I see, at least where I live, is people touting their
        knowledge of graphic design <em>because</em> they know how to use
        Photoshop &amp; co.</p>
      <p>Here’s the thing: Photoshop is not graphic design!</p>
      <p>There’s more to graphic design than being able to create graphics.
        There’s knowledge of colours, fonts, heirarchy, layouts, so on and so
        forth. Graphic design doesn’t even require a computer!</p>
      <p>So, if you know Photoshop, you know Photoshop. Not, automatically, by
        extension, graphic design.</p>
