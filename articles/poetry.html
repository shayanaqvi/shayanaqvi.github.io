      <h1>Poetry</h1>
      <p>This is something I've never thought of doing. I had a go at writing a haiku for a school thing, and I found it
        oddly enjoyable.</p>
      <p>I also have no idea what to name this page.</p>
      <p>Regardless, here are some other attemps at haikus:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Lie straight to my face<br>

          Where to, exactly?</li>
      </ol>
