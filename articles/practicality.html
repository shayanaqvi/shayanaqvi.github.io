      <h1>The Practicality of Using Obscure Software</h1>
      <p>As much as I love some of the software I use, their practicality needs to be considered. I found out about a
        lot of these pieces of software during the summer break this year; obviously, I was doing things then I'm not
        doing now, or I was not doing things I'm doing now (whichever way you want to put it).</p>
      <p>As much as I hate to admit it, I'm beginning to reconsider some of my choices with regard to software. Some of
        my stringency over using FOSS software a few months ago has absolutely gone down. Some proprietary software just
        works, and it works well enough to the point where I'm not willing to fuss around with other solutions, some of
        which may be open-source.</p>
      <p>That aside, one of my motives for writing this here is my growing frustration with some things in my
        installation of Void Linux just not working, or working rather weirdly. The headphone jack of my computer is
        literally useless, I can't use it, and I'm extremely certain it's some kind of issue with the OS. Or Bluetooth.
        Bluetooth is always finicky, it can't not be, but at times it's just going to give up on working completely.
        I'll put the machine to sleep for a few hours and come back, only to find my keyboard has disconnected and it
        will not reconnect, nor will any other Bluetooth device, no matter how many times I restart Bluetooth. What's
        the solution? Rebooting! Fun, isn't it?</p>
      <p>I have mid-term exams coming up so I don't have much time to solve these problems, but it's not like I'm even
        going to solve them. I'm going to pack things up on Void Linux one I'm free and I'm moving back to Linux Mint.
        It definitely doesn't have what I love about Void, but one thing's for certain, it most definitely does work
        ("the just works thing").</p>
      <p>FreeBSD is something I really, really want to try. However, I know for a fact that I'm going to need to
        dedicate a lot of time in order to get it to work properly. Obviously, I might be wrong.</p>
      <p>There's definitely a time and place for obscure software, lots of it is amazing, but for me, that time isn't
        now. To an extent of course, I'm not leaving Linux yet.</p>
