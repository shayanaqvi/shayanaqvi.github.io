      <h1>Random Encounters</h1>

      <p>This has to be my least favourite thing about older RPGs. I don't know much about this mechanic in newer games,
        so I'm not going to talk about that.</p>
      <p>Golden Sun on the GBA comes to mind. I got decently far into that, but random encounters threw me off the whole
        experience. They just happen much too often. You begin to anticipate them, so they aren't very random.</p>
      <p>I recently played through Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, and this was my #1 sticking about for this game. I
        can even look past the abomination that is the unskippable cutscenes there, but random encounters really began
        to grate against me. I'm lucky this game is rather short, otherwise I probably would have left it unfinished.
      </p>
      <p>The problem is: they're not random, and they get really annoying, really fast. You begin to engineer routes to
        take such that you may be able to skip the trigger for a random encounter (i.e. hugging walls). Then whenever
        you do enter one, you half-ass the battle just so that you can move on. Point is: they're not fun.</p>
      <p>One game that handles this mechanic correctly is Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga. You can actually see the enemies
        around you and decide IF you want to engage. Blissful!</p>
