      <h1>A Report on Renewable Energy</h1>
      <p>This was a school project, from back in mid/late 2021. It wasn't fun to write, but there's no harm in putting
        it
        here. If I recall correctly, this report yielded a D. Somehow. Oh, also zero plagiarism.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The topic of energy sources, specifically renewable energy sources, has come to importance in recent years, and
        for
        good reason. With the the population of the world increasing year over year, and with it projected to reach
        around 9
        to 10 billion by 2050 (UN, 2019), the amount of carbon emissions released annually is bound to increase to,
        possibly
        dangerous, levels. Switching current energy sources from single-use sources to renewable energy is one of the
        ways
        that has been recognized to reduce carbon emissions, but only around 15% of the world's energy comes from such
        sources. Why are countries adopting renewable energy sources at such a slow rate? What is stopping them from
        doing so?</p>
      <p>Is a future built upon sustainable energy feasible?</p>

      <p>The objective of this report is to go over the factors that will determine how feasible a future built upon
        renewables is for different kinds of countries.</p>

      <h2>What does the current worldwide adoption of renewable energy look like?</h2>

      <p>According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, a study conducted from 1965 to 2019 concerning the
        production
        and usage of renewable energy by countries, most countries produce around 10-20% of their primary energy from
        renewable sources, as of 2019. As compared to the 1960s, plenty of countries have adopted and developed
        renewable
        sources of energy, and have also increased the share of primary energy produced by renewables. Most countries
        still,
        however, have low shares of energy produced by renewables, especially in regions such as Africa and parts of
        Asia.</p>
      <p>Nations located in northern Europe produce a larger share of primary energy from renewables, ranging from
        around
        50%
        to as high as 80%. Southern America has also drastically increased the usage of renewables, with most countries
        producing over 10% of their energy sustainably, with some reaching as high as 45%. The main kinds of countries
        struggling to adopt renewables are developing countries.</p>
      <p>Extracted from a paper written by Dilip Ahuja and
        Marika
        Tatsutani, "Developing and emerging economies thus face a two-fold energy challenge in the 21st century: Meeting
        the
        needs of the billions of people who still lack access to basic, modern energy services while simultaneously
        participating in a global transition to clean, low-carbon energy systems. And historic rates of progress toward
        increased efficiency, de-carbonization, greater fuel diversity and lower pollutant emissions need to be greatly
        accelerated in order to do so."</p>
      <p>There are developing countries that have adopted renewables while also catering
        to
        other aspects of development. Kenya, as an example, produces around 60% of its energy renewably, with most of it
        coming from hydro-power, and some 10,000 MW of electricity produced via geothermal sources. Another such example
        is
        Brazil. From sources such as hydro-power, biomass, solar, biogas and wind, it produces around 83% of its energy.
      </p>
      <p>Other
        countries, however, have not paid the same attention to the production of such energy sources, such as Pakistan,
        with
        it producing only 7% from renewables. As for the adoption of multi-use energy sources in developed countries,
        adoption
        is generally higher than developing nations, with the exception of countries the likes of Kenya, Brazil and
        Costa
        Rica.</p>
      <p>As of 2019, the USA was producing 9% of it's energy from renewables, with most of it coming from
        hydro-electricity. Canada produced almost 28%. As for Europe, most of Fennoscandia has comparatively higher
        production
        rates of renewable energy consumption, with Iceland, as an example, producing ~80% of its energy from
        renewables,
        Norway producing ~66% and Sweden producing ~42%. The rest of Europe has lower production rates, such as Spain
        and
        Germany with ~17%, Italy with ~16%, France with ~12%, and Poland with 6%. As of the first half of 2020, Europe
        managed
        to generate more renewable energy than non-renewable.</p>

      <h2>What is Stopping Countries from Adopting Renewable Energy?</h2>

      <p>There are several factors that determine how a country will adopt renewables. Among these factors are backlash
        from
        the population, which happen mainly because of a lack of knowledge when it comes to the benefits of renewables,
        both
        financial and ecological, and the technologies used to produce renewable energy. But there is also the issue of
        the
        population being unable to know whether the implementation of renewable energy systems will be reliable in the
        long
        run.</p>
      <p>Another issue that causes backlash from the population is fact that renewable energy may cause some to lose
        their
        jobs, particularly for those who work at power plants. The uncertainty of whether they will be able to find a
        new job
        should they lose their current one may lead them to not accept, or act against, the adoption of renewables.</p>
      <p>Probably
        one of the larger factors that is slowing the adoption of renewables are monetary issues. Aside from a lack of
        money
        for some countries, which will be addressed later, countries have to compete with fossil fuels, or single-use
        energy
        sources. Pricing for such sources of energy have become rather cheap for many countries to scale the usage of.
      </p>
      <p>According to the EIA's International Energy Outlook, from 2016, around 78% of the global energy used by 2040
        are
        to be
        supplied from fossil fuels, such as oil, coal and natural gas. As for a lack of finances for many, mostly
        developing
        nations, their economy will play a large role in deciding whether investing in renewables is inherently worth it
        to
        them.</p>
      <p>The issue of underdevelopment paired with the global transition to renewable sources of energy have meant
        that
        governments of developing nations have had to either strike a balance between developing both necessities for
        its
        population and attempting to develop or adopt sources of renewable energy, or simply focusing only on developing
        what
        is needed for the population, without paying attention to developing renewables. The costs of having to design
        and
        explore facilities for developing renewable energy sources and technologies, in addition to the costs of
        actually
        purchasing the equipment, are significant for many countries. If the economic situation of a nation plays well
        with
        these circumstances, it is possible that it may try to adopt renewables, else if it does not, adoption is less
        likely.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there are technological issues when it comes to the adoption of renewables. Among these issues are
        a
        limited availability of facilities, in addition to infrastructure, especially in developing nations. A
        significant
        issue that arises when there is a lack of infrastructure and facilities is connecting renewable power-plants to
        the
        main grid.</p>
      <p>The absence of infrastructure and facilities makes this a particularly demanding task, as most
        renewable
        power-plants have to be located in more remote places. Additionally, renewable power-plants need to be
        maintained. If
        a country does not facilitate proper maintenance and operation, power-plants will become less and less reliable,
        in
        addition to producing less efficient output. Moreover, experienced personnel are required in order to properly
        maintain a power-plant, of which there are few, given that renewables are a relatively new field of technology,
        that
        has only been developed in the last few years. Lastly, proper research and development needs to be funded.</p>
      <p>Renewables
        need to be developed in order for them to be competitive with single-use fuels. If R&D is not properly funded,
        renewables will not reach the same level of usefulness that non-renewables have. This can be particularly
        problematic
        if a country is tight on money. Funding such R&D is costly, and it needs to be funded properly for the field to
        develop.</p>

      <h2>How can these issues be overcome?</h2>


      <p><strong>Lack of awareness:</strong> A lack of awareness for the population when it comes to the benefits and
        drawbacks of renewables, and the attitude that may come with it, is a significant factor that is slowing the
        adoption
        of clean energy. For this to be overcome, the public should be educated about these matters in ways they find
        convenient. This could be done through advertisements, billboards, schools or leaflets.
        Competition with non-renewables: Renewables have to be developed to the point where they are both as useful and
        as
        cheap as non-renewables are. This can be done only through proper research and development (R&D) and it being
        properly
        funded.</p>

      <p><strong>Lack of money:</strong> A lack of money for countries is a more difficult issue to solve, and plays
        into the
        topic of general development for a nation. This includes, for example, diversifying sources of income and
        improving
        relations with neighbouring countries.</p>

      <p><strong>Lack of infrastructure and facilities:</strong> This problem can be solved only if a country has access
        to
        more money. With more money, a country will be able to develop its facilities and improve its infrastructure,
        therefore allowing it to more easily integrate renewables into its energy pipeline.</p>

      <p><strong>Maintenance and operation:</strong> As mentioned before, a lack of experienced personnel means it is
        more
        difficult to properly maintain and operate a renewable power-plant. Given the young age of this field, there are
        few
        people who are experienced enough to properly maintain and operate such a power-plant. Such people can be
        trained for
        such tasks via education programs, or courses in colleges and universities.</p>

      <h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>

      <p>To conclude, a future built upon renewable energy is indeed feasible, but it requires the solving of plenty of
        problems, such as a lack of money and a lack of public awareness. However, should these problems be overcome,
        many of
        the hurdles previously slowing the development, adoption and implementation of renewables should fall, resulting
        in
        easier adoption of said energy sources.</p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>

      <p>Writing this report on the global adoption of renewables has had a tangible effect on how I now view the
        various
        issues and factors when it comes to moving away from fossil fuels. I have learnt that transitioning away from
        non-renewables is not a simple task, and that making such a change is quite demanding for a country to
        undertake,
        courtesy of the many factors which need to be kept in mind so as to appease the population and economy of a
        country
        while simultaneously benefitting the planet. This is a difficult balance to strike, which is partly why the
        adoption
        of these resources has been so slow.</p>

      <h2>Evaluation of Sources</h2>

      <p>Most of the research in this report has come from research papers, while a few facts and figures have been
        sourced
        from Wikipedia along with other websites (listed below). The information has all come from within the last 12 to
        13
        years (as of the time of writing), so while statistics may not be completely up-to-date, the actual substance
        from
        these sources still mostly stands. Given that most sources are research papers, the information is generally
        conveyed
        with neutral language and with a lack of biasedness, and are well researched, with citations being given in most
        papers.</p>
