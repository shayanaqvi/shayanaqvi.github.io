      <h1>Redesigning this Website</h1>
      <p>I enjoy reading about efforts to redesign, so I thought I’d do my
        own.</p>
      <p>I did like this site’s old design. But I could have done
        better. Here’s a screenshot of the “original”:<br />
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr0.png" alt="original site" /><br />
        <figcaption>The "original"</figcaption>
      </figure>
      I started out in Figma with this:<br />
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr1.png" alt="screenshot 1" />
      </figure>
      It carries over the vertical navigation bar from the original. It was alright, but
      I didn’t particularly love the colours and fonts. The same, but with
      solid colours instead of gradients:<br />
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr2.png" alt="screenshot 2" /><br />
      </figure>
      Had a go with a high-contrast/monochrome version of this design. I
      liked it more.<br />
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr3.png" alt="screenshot 3" /><br />
      </figure>
      Getting closer to the new layout. It is somewhat inspired from the website of Collaborative Fund.
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr4.png" alt="screenshot 4" />
      </figure>
      The font was a very conscious choice. I was a bit indecisive between Libertinus Sans (I love this font so much)
      and Piazzolla. I decided to go with Piazzolla. I could have simply set the font-face to serif, this would have
      made the site faster. But Piazzolla is a very attractive font, so I decided I would make a compromise there. I
      love
      its angular look.
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr6.png" alt="screenshot 5" />
        <figcaption>a more sensible layout</figcaption>
      </figure>
      Now came the task of translating this design to HTML and CSS. I found it not
      <em>too</em> difficult a task. It was manageable, especially with help
      from Figma’s dev tools thingy.
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr7.png" alt="screenshot 6" />
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img style="display: block; width: 250px; margin: 0 auto;" src="./media/webredo_scr5.png" alt="screenshot 7" />
        <figcaption>Figma's "devtools"</figcaption>
      </figure><br>
      Now with padding/margins…
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr8.png" alt="screenshot 8" />
      </figure>
      And a mobile layout…
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr9.png" alt="screenshot 9" />
      </figure>
      The dark mode colour scheme is the same as I mentioned in <a href="./creatingacolourscheme.html">this</a> article.
      It’s a <em>bit</em> like Solarized, but a bit warmer in its colour choice. This also shows the
      footer thing.
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr10.png" alt="screenshot 10" />
      </figure>
      Light mode colours remained the same as before.
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr11.png" alt="screenshot 11" />
      </figure>
      The same design, but starting to make use of accent colours. I chose red, green,
      and blue by accident. I only realized I had done this later on. But I
      like it still.
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr12.png" alt="screenshot 12" />
      </figure>
      The red is a bit loud here:
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr13.png" alt="screenshot 13" />
      </figure>
      Then the iconography in the footer boxes. I did the web and mail icons myself.
      The RSS icon was pre-made. These are inline SVGs. I chose to do
      this so that I could manipulate their colours without fussing around
      with filters. It will, however, make it much harder to change these
      icons in the future.
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr14.png" alt="screenshot 14" />
      </figure>
      Now comes the template file. A fun task.
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr15.png" alt="screenshot 15" />
      </figure>
      Pretty close now to the final:
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr16.png" alt="screenshot 16" />
      </figure>
      And the final! The difference between this and the screenshot above is the colours. The green is too bright above,
      a
      bit of a sore sight for a so-called “dark mode”.
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr17.png" alt="screenshot 17" />
      </figure>
      There we are!<br>
      I’m happy with this for now, and I hope I won’t bother rewriting this
      site’s CSS again. It’s a novel thing to do, but a bit draining at
      times. Which one do you like?<br></p>
