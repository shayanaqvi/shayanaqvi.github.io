      <h1>Redesigning this Website</h1>
      <p>I enjoy reading about efforts to redesign, so I thought I’d do my
        own.</p>
      <p>I did like this site’s old design. But I could have done
        better. Here’s a screenshot of the “original”:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr0.png" alt="original site" /><br />
        <figcaption>The "original"</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I started out in Figma with this:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr1.png" alt="screenshot 1" />
      </figure>
      <p>It carries over the vertical navigation bar from the original. It was alright, but
        I didn’t particularly love the colours and fonts. The same, but with
        solid colours instead of gradients:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr2.png" alt="screenshot 2" /><br />
      </figure>
      <p>Had a go with a high-contrast/monochrome version of this design. I
        liked it more.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr3.png" alt="screenshot 3" /><br />
      </figure>
      <p>Getting closer to the new layout. It is somewhat inspired from the website of Collaborative Fund.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr4.png" alt="screenshot 4" />
      </figure>
      <p>The font was a very conscious choice. I was a bit indecisive between Libertinus Sans (I love this font so much)
        and Piazzolla. I decided to go with Piazzolla. I could have simply set the font-face to serif, this would have
        made the site faster. But Piazzolla is a very attractive font, so I decided I would make a compromise there. I
        love
        its angular look.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr6.png" alt="screenshot 5" />
        <figcaption>a more sensible layout</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Now came the task of translating this design to HTML and CSS. I found it not
        <em>too</em> difficult a task. It was manageable, especially with help
        from Figma’s dev tools thingy.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr7.png" alt="screenshot 6" />
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img style="display: block; width: 250px; margin: 0 auto;" src="./media/webredo_scr5.png" alt="screenshot 7" />
        <figcaption>Figma's "devtools"</figcaption>
      </figure><br>
      <p>Now with padding/margins…</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr8.png" alt="screenshot 8" />
      </figure>
      <p>And a mobile layout…</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr9.png" alt="screenshot 9" />
      </figure>
      <p>The dark mode colour scheme is the same as I mentioned in <a href="./creatingacolourscheme.html">this</a>
        article.
        It’s a <em>bit</em> like Solarized, but a bit warmer in its colour choice. This also shows the
        footer thing.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr10.png" alt="screenshot 10" />
      </figure>
      <p>Light mode colours remained the same as before.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr11.png" alt="screenshot 11" />
      </figure>
      <p>The same design, but starting to make use of accent colours. I chose red, green,
        and blue by accident. I only realized I had done this later on. But I
        like it still.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr12.png" alt="screenshot 12" />
      </figure>
      <p>The red is a bit loud here:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr13.png" alt="screenshot 13" />
      </figure>
      <p>Then the iconography in the footer boxes. I did the web and mail icons myself.
        The RSS icon was pre-made. These are inline SVGs. I chose to do
        this so that I could manipulate their colours without fussing around
        with filters. It will, however, make it much harder to change these
        icons in the future.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr14.png" alt="screenshot 14" />
      </figure>
      <p>Now comes the template file. A fun task.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr15.png" alt="screenshot 15" />
      </figure>
      <p>Pretty close now to the final:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr16.png" alt="screenshot 16" />
      </figure>
      <p>And the final! The difference between this and the screenshot above is the colours. The green is too bright
        above,
        a
        bit of a sore sight for a so-called “dark mode”.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./media/webredo_scr17.png" alt="screenshot 17" />
      </figure>
      <p>There we are!</p>
      <p>I’m happy with this for now, and I hope I won’t bother rewriting this
        site’s CSS again. It’s a novel thing to do, but a bit draining at
        times. Which one do you like?</p>
