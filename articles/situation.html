      <h1>The Situation</h1>
      <p>I'm taking 4 subjects for college. After two weeks, I'm beginning to get an idea of what I need to focus on.
      </p>
      <p>Math is good. Computer Science is good. Physics should be good. Chemistry needs work.</p>
      <p>I feel like the way I did chemistry during my IGCSEs was not ideal. It turns out that memorizing a bunch of
        things for the short term does not suffice for the long term. I am finding myself a bit clueless with a
        few things, so a refresher is needed.</p>
      <p>But all in due time. I have <em>some</em> time, not a lot of time, but some. All should go well if I apply
        myself.</p>
