      <h1>Speaking Slowly</h1>
      <p>It's to do with clarity. I can slow myself down in conversation with someone, but in those extremely short
        exchanges
        with someone, where all I need to say is "okay" or "yes" or "no", they turn out problematic.</p>
      <p>That's because they sound a bit like grunting. Try saying "okay" really fast, and you'll see where I'm coming
        from. I wouldn't say it makes a great impression, especially
        with acquaintances.
