      <h1>Social Interactions in a World of Smartphones</h1>
      <p>No, I am not the first to notice this. Nor will I be the last. In my eyes, this is a very real problem.<br><br>
        I find, that in today's world, it <em>can</em> be hard to interact with <em>some</em> people because of phones.
        Not
        <em>all</em> people, mind you,
        there are plenty who don't seem to have this problem. But there <em>are</em> some who do. For some people, you
        simply
        cannot
        interact with them without <em>the phone</em> being present in some way. Even if they don't use it, it's in
        their
        hands, always ready to be accessed.<br><br>
        I suppose a portion of the problem concerns the usage of the phone rather than the phone itself. But the usage
        of the
        phone tends to come
        from a certain kind of upbringing. This upbringing is one where <em>the phone</em> is the way to handle the
        child when
        they are very young. <em>The phone</em> is the way to keep them busy when they are a bit older. <em>The
          phone</em>
        what you give them when they are 10 years old. <em>The phone</em> is what you give them unrestricted access to.
        I'm
        sure it's not hard to see the problem here.<br><br>
        So when a child grows up with a phone constantly in their face, it's inevitable that they continue this habit
        when
        they get older.<br><br>
        <em>The phone</em> is the solution to boredom, to social awkwardness, to other similar inconveniences. The
        instant
        gratification of being momentarily entertained and distracted from the situation at hand must be a very strong
        and
        attractive force.<br><br>
        <em>The phone</em> is growing to become (or has become) a very big problem, at least in my eyes. It's at the
        point
        where its benefits are beginning to subdue to its ever-increasing drawbacks.
