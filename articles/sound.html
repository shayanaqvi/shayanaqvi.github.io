			<h1>Sound</h1>
			<h2>Storing sound</h2>
			<p>A sound wave is input into a sound encoder. A sound encoder is composed of the following components:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Band-limiting filter</h3>
					<p>A band-limiting filter is used to remove high-frequency parts of a sound that cannot be heard by humans.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Analogue-to-digital converter</h3>
					<p>This converts analogue data into digital data. In the case of sound, it converts sound waves into a digital
						format, so that it can be processed by a computer.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Sampling</h2>
			<p>This refers to measuring the amplitude of a sound at regular time intervals.</p>
			<h3>Sampling resolution</h3>
			<p>The resolution of a sample is the number of bits used to store it. A larger resolution will make more values
				available for storage, and will improve the accuracy and reduce the distortion of the, now digitised, sound.</p>
			<h3>Sampling rate</h3>
			<p>Sampling rate is the rate at which sounds are sampled; an amount of samples per second. More samples per second
				will result in better accuracy of the sound.</p>
			<h3>Nyquist's theorem</h3>
			<p>Sampling should be done at a frequency at least twice the highest frequency of the sound in the sample.</p>
			<h3>The pros and cons of using a higher sampling rate and resolution</h3>
