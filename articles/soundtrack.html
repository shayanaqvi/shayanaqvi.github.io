      <h1>The soundtrack of the past few months</h1>
      <p>The stuff I've been listening to over the past few months has been all over the place. It's been revolving
        mostly around video game music though.</p>
      <h2>Artists</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Aphex Twin</h3>
          <p>He's been on very regular rotation since December. I got through most of his albums pretty quickly, and I
            did like all of them. For the longest time I avoided Selected Ambient Works Vol. 2, but I went through that
            a few weeks ago and it's really good!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>日比野則彦</h3>
          <p>I'm not going to pretend I know who this guy is but he ranks #4 on my top artists of all time on Last FM.
            He is one of the guys responsible for Metal Gear Solid 2s soundtrack, and I've listened to that pretty
            regularly since December.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Bandai Namco</h3>
          <p>The soundtracks of Tekken 5 and Tekken 6.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>大平勇</h3>
          <p>This guy did a lot of the music for the Gran Turismo 4 soundtrack, and that thing was on like daily
            rotation for a lot of March.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Massive Attack</h3>
          <p>These guys are probably within a top 5 with regard to favourite artists. Over the past few months though, I
            haven't listened to them much except for a song from Heligoland, United Snakes. That track is about 10
            minutes long but it's such an easy song to just put on in the background and forget about. It's pretty loud,
            but it works really well as background music.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>坂東慧</h3>
          <p>He did some music from the Gran Turismo 5 soundtrack. He did one song on that, Dark Line, which I have
            listened the hell out of since March and it still hasn't gotten old. I've racked up about 200 scrobbles on
            that song alone since march.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>石元丈晴</h3>
          <p>I'm pretty sure he's done a lot more than just the soundtrack to Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, but that's
            where I've gotten all my plays of him. Apparently the soundtrack to Crisis Core isn't the best Final Fantasy
            soundtrack, but it was really good in my books. I quite liked Night of Seclusion, also a few of the more
            heavy rock songs there (Black Wing Unfurled comes to mind).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Sons of Kemet</h3>
          <p>I listened to these guys a lot more back last November, but I recently went through <em>Your Queen is a
              Reptile</em>. I still have yet to go through that album properly, but one of the songs there, <em>Your
              Queen is Nanny of the Maroons</em> worked really well as a background song. I racked up about 100
            scrobbles on that thing in about 2-3 days.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Albums</h2>
      <p>Some of the stuff that doesn't fall under the Artists section.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Persona 4 & Persona 4 Golden Soundtracks</h3>
        </li>

          <h3>The Great Escape - Blur</h3>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Hospitality 2016</h3>
          <p>A very large drum and bass compilation from Hospital Records. I got into that stuff for a while, mostly
            courtesy of a few songs I was familiar with before: Lust Thrust (Krakota) and Komodo (Whiney). I'm still not
            fully aquainted with this compilation, but I do quite like it.</p>

          <p>I am never going to remember the name of this song in its entirety. I found this out of nowhere in my
            library and put it on repeat for a few days.</p>
