      <h1>Work/Study Tunes</h1>
      <p>If I need "neutral" music to work/study to, I tend to just put a song, or put a few songs, on repeat. These
        are some of my favourite for that purpose.</p>

      <p>Side note: I have lost complete faith in lofi hiphop music. I don't want to say it, but it's often pretty
        boring, and
        dare I
        say, bland music. It's not distracting, so that's a positive. But I can't bring myself to listen to that stuff
        anymore.</p>
      <p>I wouldn't call most of these suitable for studying if you listen with headphones. This stuff works great at a
        lower-mid volume on a speaker, because you can hear just enough detail to keep your ears enterntained but not
        enough to get distracted.</p>
      <p>As an example, Harrison's Out of the Blue. It's a genuinely wonderful track. Instrumental, but incredibly
        detailed. I could not study to that stuff with headphones. I can, and do, study to it on speakers, for the
        reasons I mentioned above.</p>
