      <h1>Why Tech Literacy is Important</h1>
      <p>I'll leave the definition and extent of tech literacy up to you to decide.</p>
      <p>But in essence, it's important to be technologically literate so that corporations can't make a fool of you.
        Google, as an example, would love to DRM the web under the guise of <em>protecting the user</em>, and people who
        don't know any better believe this stuff. They believe that Google cares about them, and thus support these
        kinds of monopolistic efforts that benefit nobody but Google.</p>
      <p>By choosing to not be reasonably literate about the devices/software we use a lot nowadays, we're allowing
        ourselves to
        be made a fool of. We're allowing companies to profit off of us like never before. We're allowing companies
        to abuse our willingness to use their products.</p>
      <p>We're keeping corporations in power. We don't want that, do we?</p>
