      <h1>No-fuss Terminal Workspace</h1>
      <p>Working in the terminal is something that I have been steadily
        warming up to over the past few months. I think its obvious that this
        kind of workflow isn‚Äôt for everyone, but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to try it out,
        does it? Here, I will share a few terminal apps that I found pretty easy to use.</p>

      <h2 id="text-editing">Text editing</h2>
      <p>There are many options for text editing in the terminal, and this has
        become my preferred way of writing notes and writing code. There are,
        obviously, downsides to this approach, but, generally, I feel like this
        constitutes a net positive in my books. The gain in speed, especially
        when you take the time to learn your way around a text editor is
        amazing. Options are plentiful, but plenty require lots of
        configuration.</p>
      <p>My personal favourite, the one I‚Äôve been using for probably about the
        last month/month and a half is Helix. And for about half of that time, I
        used Helix with close to no configuration. Out of the box, Helix is
        extremely usable. It has pretty sane defaults, and most things come
        preconfigured in a way that isn‚Äôt particularly intrusive. Now, I have
        made some changes, but I wouldn‚Äôt say that any of them are required.
        It‚Äôs mostly just minor tweaks.</p>
      <p>The other great thing with Helix is LSP support out-of-the-box. In
        fact, I would say it‚Äôs more trouble installing LSPs than getting them to
        work.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="media/tw_helix.png" alt="" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Helix, editing my Qtile configuration (in
          XFCE ü§î)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The learning curve here is quite steep, a bit less so if you come
        from Vi/Vim/Neovim. This learning curve is mostly getting the hand of
        modal text editing (which I will leave to others to explain).</p>
      <p>Vim/Neovim are very competent text editors. I‚Äôve never gone all-out
        on configuring them, nor have I used any preconfigured ‚Äúdistributions‚Äù
        of Neovim for any longer than a few minutes, but these are wonderful
        pieces of software.</p>
      <p>Emacs is a very capable piece of software that <em>can</em> be used
        for text editing. I spent most of my time in Emacs using the
        preconfigured <em>Doom</em> Emacs. This comes with vim keybindings
        out-of-the-box, so text editing is an alright experience. I did try
        setting up an LSP for Python a few times, and that experience wasn‚Äôt
        great. It was rather slow. But what I liked the most about Emacs was
        org-mode. It is a much better kind of markup language, and its very
        capable. It‚Äôs problem is that its featureset is pretty much limited to
        Emacs. But aside from that, Emacs is certainly worth a try.</p>
      <p>Right before I jumped on the Vim/Emacs/Helix bandwagon, I spent about
        2 days with Micro. Micro is like a better version of GNU Nano. No modal
        editing, but from what I recall, a better experience than Nano.</p>
      <p>All that said, I think for a no-fuss approach to text editing in the
        terminal, give Helix or Micro a try.</p>
      <h2 id="terminal-multiplexers">Terminal Multiplexers</h2>
      <p>The hell is a terminal multiplexer??</p>
      <p>If you‚Äôre aware of the concept of window managers (basically a piece
        of software that manages your windows), it‚Äôs like one of those,
        but for your terminal. Terminals such as Kitty do come with this
        feature, but I think most of the value of terminal multiplexers comes
        from using software like Tmux or Zellij.</p>
      <p>Tmux is an alright piece of software, in my opinion. It takes plenty
        of configuring to be able to use properly, but once you‚Äôve reached the
        point where you‚Äôre happy with your configuration, it‚Äôs plenty
        usable.</p>
      <p>Recently, however, I came across Zellij, and it‚Äôs genuinely
        wonderful! This is another one of those pieces of terminal software that
        is pretty no-fuss. It has sane defaults, and literally the only change
        I‚Äôve made to its configuration is its colourscheme. I have changed
        literally nothing else, because there‚Äôs no need. It manages splits in a
        similar manner to window managers like DWM or Qtile, and a great feature
        is the ability to have floating windows, <em>in the terminal</em>! It‚Äôs
        a great piece of software, and while it‚Äôs not perfect, it gets most of
        the way.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="media/tw_zellij.png" alt="" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Very practical and realistic usage of
          Zellij</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h2 id="music">Music Players</h2>
      <p>My experience with terminal music players has mostly been MPD
        frontends, so I will not talk about non-MPD terminal music players (such
        as cmus or moc). What I will talk about before touching on MPD frontends
        is Musikcube. Musikcube is, to my knowledge, a music server (like MPD)
        and a music player. I used it without paying much heed to its music
        server feature, and I got plenty far that way. Also, I needed to
        configure absolutely nothing for it to be usable.</p>
      <p>That being said, options are more plentiful on the MPD side of
        things. One thing to note is that many mpd clients have terrible names.
        The two I‚Äôm most well versed with are ncmpcpp and nncmpp. Both are quite
        nice, require very, very little configuration (if any), and can get you
        pretty far. Ncmpcpp is probably the more powerful of the two.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="media/tw_ncmpcpp.png" alt="" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">ncmpcpp</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Both can be navigated with the keyboard, but mouse support in
        <code>nncmpp</code> is top tier. Great stuff.
      </p>
      <h2 id="file-management">File Management</h2>
      <p>File management is something that can be done purely in the terminal.
        But using a frontend usually makes things a bit easier.</p>
      <p>Options here are plentiful, but I have mostly used
        <code>ranger</code> and <code>xplr</code>. I‚Äôve only touched others like
        <code>nnn</code> and <code>lf</code> a few times (though <code>lf</code>
        is pretty much ranger).
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="media/tw_xplr.png" alt="" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">xplr</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Again, you can do lots of things here without much configuration, and
        navigating these apps are plenty fast.</p>
      <p>A new file manager I came across is <code>clifm</code>. I haven‚Äôt
        used it much, but this is also pretty powerful and doesn‚Äôt require much
        configuration.</p>
      <h2 id="other-apps">Other Apps</h2>
      <p>Lazygit is pretty nice. Very usable out-of-the-box; I don‚Äôt even know
        where it‚Äôs configuration file is located.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="media/tw_lazygit.png" alt="" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">lazygit</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>RSS readers such as Newsboat can also go a long way, but this isn‚Äôt
        something I prefer doing in the terminal, I get to why below.</p>
      <h2 id="no-thanks">No Thanks!</h2>
      <p>Web browsing in the terminal is a big no-go for me. There are many
        options (browsh is pretty cool), but all of them, and I mean all of
        them, are an extremely substandard and subpar experience. This is,
        obviously, courtesy of the absolute mess that is the modern web. Pure
        HTML sites are usable, but this is becoming an increasingly rare breed
        of websites.</p>
      <p>Email is something I haven‚Äôt got into much myself (I set up alpine
        and used that a bit for a few weeks). I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs doable and can be
        a nice experience, but this requires a lot of configuration from what I
        know. I could, however, very much be wrong.</p>
      <p>As I mentioned before, RSS reading. It‚Äôs probably the best web-based
        terminal experience you‚Äôre going to get. Reading RSS in the terminal is
        very much practical, doesn‚Äôt require too much configuration, and is
        quite nice at times. But generally, I feel like I get a better
        experience here with GUI apps.</p>
