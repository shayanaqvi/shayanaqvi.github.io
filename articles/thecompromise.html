      <h1>The Compromise I</h1>
      <p>It's pretty common knowledge that in order to avail a degree of privacy on the internet you've got to
        compromise
        convenience or ease-of-use.</p>
      <p>Search engines suck. All of them. The ones that give you good good search results are privacy nightmares
        (<em>kind
          of</em> (but not very) logically). The ones that actually kind of care about your privacy give you really bad
        results.</p>
      <p>I'm trying out Mojeek. By golly, unless I search for something or someone really well known, I find that close
        to all
        results are terrible. I tend to simply copy my search query, and search for the same thing in Duckduckgo.
      </p>
      <p>Duckduckgo ain't great. But you know what? I feel like its the best middle ground there is. Let me clarify,
        that this
        <em>is not</em> a high bar to clear. Duckduckgo (most probably) does not care about you or your privacy. But
        it's
        better than Google in that regard <em>and</em> gives somewhat decent search results.
      </p>
      <p>Apparently Brave isn't that much better, and they seem like kind of a shady company with some things they've
        done.
        Their results, from what I recall, in my experience, were worse than Duckduckgo, but most definately better than
        Mojeek.</p>
      <p>I suppose there are two problems (with search engines). There's getting away from Google/Microsoft & company,
        then
        there's protecting your privacy. If you choose to ignore your privacy, you'll get a moderately good experience
        (sans
        privacy). If you choose to forgo Google/Microsoft, you'll also get a moderately okay experience. But if you
        choose to
        protect your privacy AND get away from big tech, you're in for a hard time right now.</p>
      <p>Such is the situation. Isn't it a pity?</p>
