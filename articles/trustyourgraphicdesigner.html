    <h1>Trust your graphic designer!</h1>
    <p>I do graphic design work, some hobbyist, but nowadays mostly for events at school and/or other projects. There's one frustration I have in that sort of position: a lack of trust.</p>
    <p>By golly, if you asked me to design something, you should trust that I know what I'm doing. This has happened so many times: I'll design something, or many somethings, and they'll be dismissed with zero rationale. It happens a lot! People can be extremely quick to dismiss work without giving much thought about it. I don't even get the margin to explain sometimes.</p>
    <p>Moreover, you can give me feedback, as much as you want, and I'll take it. I don't have a problem with feedback, or criticism. As long as it's reasonable! You can tell things I could change, maybe things I should change, but don't tell me I have to change this specifically, make that a certain way, so on and so forth. Feedback as suggestions, not as orders. At the end of the day, if you asked someone else to design something when you have little background in that field, chances are your designer knows better! Trust them!</p>
