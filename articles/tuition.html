      <h1>Tuition Centres</h1>
      <p>This seems to be a pretty profitable business where I live.</p>
      <p>I don't know what it is, but I have many friends who go to these places. They spend their mornings/afternoons
        at school, then spend their evenings and/or nights at tuition centres (or "academies" as they are commonly
        referred to here).</p>
      <p>In case you don't know, a tuition centre is basically a kind of school. They tend not to have the kinds of
        facilities of proper schools. Needless to say, going to school <em>and</em> then going to a tuition centre is
        like going to school twice a day.</p>
      <p>I know friends who have been doing this for years. It just makes no sense to me - what life do you have, at
        that point, outside of school? When you spend, quite literally, your entire day in a school-like setting, when
        do you get the time for hobbies? To learn things that <em>aren't</em> school? So on and so forth.</p>
      <p>The other thing with this whole culture is that I have seen people prioritise the work/homework (yes, homework)
        of these tuition centres over regular school. This is something a student genuinely said: "Oh, I couldn't study
        for this test because I had a test at my academy" (translated, but to the same effect).</p>
      <p>I suppose this works out if you take one, or two, subjects here. If you struggle in physics, then taking
        physics at a tuition centre is alright. No problem there. But everything? 8 subjects if you take IGCSE!</p>
      <p>It could just be that these places utilize clever marketing. Parents here do care about grades - some more than
        others - and more often than not, it is parents that send their children to tuition centres. Something something
        being sold something you don't <em>need</em>.</p>
      <p>Entire friend groups exist (in school!) that go to the same tuition centre!</p>
      <p>I know that school is important (more so in underdeveloped places). But I swear, it isn't <em>that</em>
        important.</p>
