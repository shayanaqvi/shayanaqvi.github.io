            text editing)</h1>
          <p class="article-date">01/08/2023</p>
          <p>This article is not about the problems <em>of</em> Vim. It’s about
            the problem of the <em>concept</em> of Vim. Not just Vim, for that
            matter, but similar software, such as Helix and company.</p>
          <h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
          <p>For the sake of this article, I’m going to ignore any differences
            between text editors such as Vim and Neovim and Kakoune and Helix and
            the other millions of terminal text editors. To me, at least,
            <em>the</em> benefit (or the <em>main</em> benefit) of these text
            editors is not their performance or plugins or features or whatever.
            It’s the modal text editing. That’s what keeps me hooked to these
            amazing pieces of software.
          </p>
          <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
          <p>My problem with getting used to this kind of text editing is that you
            become so accustomed to it, that it becomes genuinely difficult
            adjusting to any plain ol’ non-modal text editor. Now, after about a
            year of using modal text editing as a primary way of manipulating text,
            I find it gruesome using non-modal text editing.</p>
          <p>If you’re a Vim user, you have an <em>amount</em> of luck, in this regard.
            There exist web extensions and VSCode extentions and Obsidian extentions
            (and so on) that let you use Vim’s modal editing in their apps. This is
            great, and while most of these are nowhere near perfect, they get you
            <em>most</em> of the way. Then, it’s possible to use alternatives to Vim
            while maintaining its modal editing.
          </p>
          <p>But if you use a more obscure text editor, like Helix or Kakoune,
            then you’re pretty much out of options. <em>Some</em> apps offer
            Kakoune’s modal editing, but very, very few offer Helix’s modal editing
            (all I recall is a VSCode extension). This brings us to the problem: an
            abundance of alternatives. Of this abundance of alternatives, very few
            are available to you <em>if</em> you wish to retain your text editing
            muscle memory.</p>
          <p>Thing is, this is perfectly okay. I shouldn't expect major pieces of software to have extensions for niche
            text editing apps. That expectation is not realistic, is it?</p>
          <p>Of course, I could simply switch back to Vim, have my piece of cake
            and eat it too, but honestly, I’d rather not (my, rather subjective
            opinion, is that Helix’s modal editing is superior to Vim’s).</p>
          <p>Regardless, if this is the case, I suppose I don’t have any right to complain.
            Thus, I shall stop right here.</p>
          <p>If you have any thoughts, feel free to leave a comment. Have a nice
            day!</p>
