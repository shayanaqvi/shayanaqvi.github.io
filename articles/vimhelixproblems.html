      <h1>Qualms with Vim (or modal text editing)</h1>
      <p>This article is not about the problems <em>of</em> Vim. It’s about
        the problem of the <em>concept</em> of Vim. Not just Vim, for that
        matter, but similar software, such as Helix and company.</p>
      <h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
      <p>For the sake of this article, I’m going to ignore any differences
        between text editors such as Vim and Neovim and Kakoune and Helix and
        the other millions of terminal text editors. To me, at least,
        <em>the</em> benefit (or the <em>main</em> benefit) of these text
        editors is not their performance or plugins or features or whatever.
        It’s the modal text editing. That’s what keeps me hooked to these
        amazing pieces of software.
      </p>
      <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
      <p>My problem with getting used to this kind of text editing is that you
        become so accustomed to it, that it becomes genuinely difficult
        adjusting to any plain ol’ non-modal text editor. Now, after about a
        year of using modal text editing as a primary way of manipulating text,
        I find it gruesome using non-modal text editing.</p>
      <p>If you’re a Vim user, you have an <em>amount</em> of luck, in this regard.
        There exist web extensions and VSCode extentions and Obsidian extentions
        (and so on) that let you use Vim’s modal editing in their apps. This is
        great, and while most of these are nowhere near perfect, they get you
        <em>most</em> of the way. Then, it’s possible to use alternatives to Vim
        while maintaining its modal editing.
      </p>
      <p>But if you use a more obscure text editor, like Helix or Kakoune,
        then you’re pretty much out of options. <em>Some</em> apps offer
        Kakoune’s modal editing, but very, very few offer Helix’s modal editing
        (all I recall is a VSCode extension).</p>
      <p>This brings us to the problem: using alternative text editors. Of these alternatives, very few
        are available to you <em>if</em> you wish to retain your text editing
        muscle memory.</p>
      <p>Thing is, this is perfectly okay. I shouldn't expect major pieces of software to have extensions for niche
        text editing apps. That expectation is not realistic, is it?</p>
      <p>Of course, I could simply switch back to Vim, have my piece of cake
        and eat it too, but honestly, I’d rather not (my, rather subjective
        opinion, is that Helix’s modal editing is superior to Vim’s).</p>
      <p>Regardless, if this is the case, I suppose I don’t have any right to complain.
        Thus, I shall stop right here.</p>
