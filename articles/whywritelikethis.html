      <h1>Why write like this?</h1>
      <p>"In the aftermath of the U.S. Civil War, Ezra Cornell wrote, "I would found an insitution where any person can
        find instruction in any study". For over 150 years, Cornell University has remained deeply committed to Ezra's
        vision. Explain how your life experiences will help inform your contributions to a learning community devoted to
        "... any person ... any study." We encourage you to think broadly about your life experiences, including how
        local (e.g., family, school, neighbourhood) or global communities you've been part of have helped shape your
        perspective."</p>
      <p>A friend is applying to Cornell and he came across this question. Amazing stuff.</p>
      <p>I can get why they write like this, but does it need to be this vague?</p>
      <p>I'm one to speak though. A friend messaged me asking me for a list of topics we've studied in Chemistry. I
        reply, "indeed I can". He asks if I will. I ask, "should I?". Annoying as it may be, it's seriously fun toying
        around with people like this.</p>
      <p>"Have you registered for [event]?"</p>
      <p>"Nothing is certain."</p>
