            <p class="article-listing-preview">Following Youtube channels through RSS is a great quality-of-life
              improvement. I don’t expect this "feature" to last particularly long given where
              Google is taking the site, but it works for now.</p>

            <h2>Avoiding the News</h2>
            <p class="article-date">31/07/2023</p>
            <p>I came across an article by Rolf Dobelli; it’s about avoiding the
              news. I don’t have much new to say about news in particular, not at this
              moment in time, but I just wanted to share some insights from this
              article that I found interesting. I don’t necessarily agree with all of
              these, but I found them interesting nonetheless.</p>

            <p class="article-date">29/07/2023</p>
            <p>Working in the terminal is something that I have been steadily
              warming up to over the past few months. I think its obvious that this
              kind of workflow isn’t for everyone, but it doesn’t hurt to try it out,
              does it?</p>
