            <h6>01/08/2023</h6>
            <p>This article is not about the problems of Vim. It's about the problem of the concept of Vim. Not just
              Vim, for that
              matter, but similar software, such as Helix and company.</p>

            <h1>Avoiding the News</h1>
            <h6>31/07/2023</h6>
            <p>I came across an article by Rolf Dobelli; it’s about avoiding the news. I don’t have much new to say
              about news in particular, not at this moment in time, but I just wanted to share some insights from this
              article that I found interesting. I don’t necessarily agree with all of these, but I found them
              interesting nonetheless.

            <h1>No-fuss Terminal Workspace</h1>
            <h6>29/07/2023</h6>
            <p>Working in the terminal is something that I have been steadily warming up to over the past few months. I
              think its obvious that this kind of workflow isn’t for everyone, but it doesn’t hurt to try it out, does
              it?
