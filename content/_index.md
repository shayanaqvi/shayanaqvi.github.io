Hello! I'm Shayan Naqvi.

Currently, I'm a second-year A Level student studying chemistry, computer science, math and physics. *Vaguely* related to this is the content on my blog! I sometimes write about whatever I'm studying, but mostly [ramble about various interests/hobbies of mine]({{< ref "blog/_index.md" >}}), mostly revolving around computers. Other interests/hobbies of mine include: 
- Linux (not that you asked)
- Music (by the accounts of some of my friends, I have a weird taste in music, and apparently listen to a lot of "circus music")
- Graphic/visual design (check out [my "works" page]({{< ref "/works/works.md" >}}) if you'd like to see some of my work). 
- Cooking
- Knitting (scarves, mostly)

Feel free to say hello! [The only way to do that is through email](mailto:contact.shayanaqvi@icloud.com).

If you're in the mood to read:
1. licenses, check out "[About this website]({{< ref "info.md" >}})".
2. the content here elsewhere, [there is an RSS feed](index.xml)!
