Following Youtube channels through RSS is a great quality-of-life improvement. I donâ€™t expect this "feature" to last particularly long given where Google is taking the site, but it works for now.

# Getting a feed for a channel

1. go to the channel you want to follow
2. inspect page source
3. search for "RSS"
  {{<image
    src="img/youtube-rss/ytrss_screenshot1.png"
  >}}
4. copy the URL containing the channel ID
5. add this to your feed reader

The consumption experience is better if you can get a feed reader that can display webpages. I use Thunderbird with uBlock, and this is a good enough way for me to follow Youtube.
