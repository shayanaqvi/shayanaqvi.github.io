I enjoy reading about efforts to redesign, so I thought I’d do my own.

I did like this site’s old design. But I could have done better. Here’s a screenshot of the “original”:

{{< image 
  frame="true"
  src="img/webredo/webredo_scr0.png"
  caption="The \"original\""
>}}

I started out in Figma with this:

{{< image 
  frame="true"
  src="img/webredo/webredo_scr1.png"
>}}

It carries over the vertical navigation bar from the original, but I don't particularly love the colours and fonts. The same, but with solid colours below:

{{< image 
  frame="true"
  src="img/webredo/webredo_scr2.png"
>}}

Had a go with a high-contrast/monochrome version of this design. I liked it more.

{{< image 
  frame="true"
  src="img/webredo/webredo_scr3.png"
>}}

Getting closer to the new layout. It's somewhat inspired from the website of Collaborative Fund.

{{< image 
  frame="true"
  src="img/webredo/webredo_scr4.png"
>}}

{{< image 
  frame="true"
  src="img/webredo/webredo_scr6.png"
  caption="A more sensible layout"
>}}

Now came the task of translating this design to HTML/CSS. I found it not too difficult a task, especially with help from Figma's dev tools thingy.

{{< image 
  frame="true"
  float="left"
  src="img/webredo/webredo_scr7.png"
>}}

Now with padding/margins...

{{< image 
  frame="true"
  src="img/webredo/webredo_scr8.png"
>}}

And a mobile layout...

{{< image 
  frame="true"
  src="img/webredo/webredo_scr9.png"
>}}

The dark mode colour scheme is the same as I mentioned [in this article](https://shayanaqvi.github.io/articles/creatingacolourscheme.html). It’s a bit like Solarized, but a bit warmer in its colour choice. This also shows the footer thing.

{{< image 
  frame="true"
  src="img/webredo/webredo_scr10.png"
>}}

Light mode colours remained the same as before.

{{< image 
  frame="true"
  src="img/webredo/webredo_scr11.png"
>}}

The same design, but starting to make use of accent colours.

{{< image 
  frame="true"
  src="img/webredo/webredo_scr12.png"
>}}

Then the iconography in the footer boxes. I did the web and mail icons myself. The RSS icon was pre-made.

{{< image 
  frame="true"
  src="img/webredo/webredo_scr14.png"
>}}

Now comes the template file.

{{< image 
  frame="true"
  src="img/webredo/webredo_scr15.png"
>}}

The final:

{{< image 
  frame="true"
  src="img/webredo/webredo_scr17.png"
>}}

There we are!

I’m happy with this for now, and I hope I won’t bother rewriting this site’s CSS again. It’s a novel thing to do, but a bit draining at times.
