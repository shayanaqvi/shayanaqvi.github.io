About a year ago/year and a half ago (as of the time of writing), I did some dabbling around with Blender. Here is some of the stuff I modeled.

# Braun BC12 Alarm Clock

*Something* went wrong with the shape of the clock; it's weirdly polygonal. But I still like it.

A close-up of the hands:

Some of the knobs/dials on the back:

# Bench & Table Scene

The scene uses furniture from Fredericia (a recurring theme) I modelled. I am quite partial to the floor tiling, though I would probably hate it in real life.

The texturing on the legs of the benches did go a bit awry.

# Fredericia Mogensen Table

The table from the scene above.

# Fredericia Pato Chair

# Fredericia J64 Chair

The texturing on the legs is pretty bad. Rather unfortunately, I didn't notice this oddity until *after* it had spent the amount of hours it had rendering.

# Panic Playdate

This was quite fun to model. There are a *few* inaccuracies, if you know where to look.

# The Donut

Can't miss this, though I find the choice of background colour rather unfortunate.
