I'm talking about the use of animations in interface design.

The point is, I don't want to wait for your animations!

They slow down the usage experience. Waiting for a paragraph to bounce into frame, or images to slide into the viewport are things that slow down navigating a site/app/whatever. The problem is having to *wait* for them to happen. These kinds of animations may look nice, but they're only good when you don't have to wait for them!

I'm here to see the content of your site, not your site's blingy animations! Make them faster, or remove them entirely! If I have to wait, for any unreasonable amoutn of time, to see the contents of a paragraph because your fancy animation wants to act like a special snowflake, then a bad impression follows without saying.

You have two options: ðŸ”« make them fast, or get rid of them.
