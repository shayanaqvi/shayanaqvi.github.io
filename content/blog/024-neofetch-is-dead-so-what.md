There's a case to be made for not using unsupported software, but it really depends.

I've been seeing videos on Youtube regarding the end-of-life for neofetch, and they're all talking about alternatives to it. For this sort of thing, you don't really need alternatives, do you?

I mean, neofetch is literally just a system info application. So what if it isn't updated anymore? It's not like it's incredibly buggy or something, nor does it have any major security flaws. If neofetch told you your system information when it was being maintained, it'll still do the same now. Keep using it then! You don't need alternatives to it!
