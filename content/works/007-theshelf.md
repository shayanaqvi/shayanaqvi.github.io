I got the idea for this from those boards you see on Pinterest. This is that but for whatever I found interesting/liked. It started out with a variety of content, but eventually became a thing where I put whatever music I liked. I'm not against that idea, actually, and I'd like to revive this thing in the future but: 

(a) make it easier to update - I used to manually add HTML to this.

(b) keep it for music ONLY.
