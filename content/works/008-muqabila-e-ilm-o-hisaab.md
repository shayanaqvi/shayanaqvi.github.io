*Muqabila e Ilm o Hisaab* was a math olympiad by a collective known as *Mehfil*. We collaborated with a private tuition academy, *Rubrics*, to host it.

The work I did here is nowehere near my best, but there are a few things here I do like. I'll be showing those below.

# Promotional Standee

Looking back at this, an issue with these I've noticed is the bit that says "Rs. 799". I should have indicated that was the registration fee.

I also did a version with the colours flipped, and it was this one we ended up using:

# Question & Answer Sheets

I'm only going to put one page of the question sheet below, but you can see [the full version as a PDF](/files/mioh/qs.pdf).

# Event Proposal

[Here's the full document](/files/mioh/proposal.pdf). We showed this to the guys at Rubrics to get them on board. The colours here were before we decided on a palette for the olympiad.
