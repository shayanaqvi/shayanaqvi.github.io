I'm giving the [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/) a go, so naturally, I started with pong.

This version of pong includes the following:
- single-player against a (rough but beatable) computer opponent
- multi-player against a local opponent
- configurable end-game condition
- menus (a main and pause menu)
