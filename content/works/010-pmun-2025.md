I handled most of the graphics/branding/social media content for this event alongside a co-director and a team of two. I'll put *some* of the work we did here. All of this work was done in Figma.

You can view the page in its current form (as of April 2025) [here](https://www.instagram.com/pmun.25?igsh=MWkxOWthOXozbXR3YQ==).

By and large, I'm quite happy with how the graphics for this event turned out.

# Logo

I like this logo! There were no issues with scaling this time, and it was legible in pretty much all formats.

If we ever needed a *much* smaller logo, we opted to use a negative version of the logo above:

# Instagram Posts

The only thing I have against these is that the text is a *bit* too glowy. But other than that, I like these.

A bit of a side note about the background: everything here uses only one background image made by my co-director. In order to ensure we could reuse this any many times as possible, I would crop the image to a random section, rotate it however looked good and then apply a blur + grain effect to mask the lower resolution. This is EXACTLY the sort of thing I should have done [last year for the Nobelium Cup]({{< ref "006-the-nobelium-cup.md" >}}). Nobody we showed our work to seemed to be able to tell that we were doing this! You might be able to tell though if you look closely. Mind you, this wasn't a perfect solution but I think it was a step in the right direction.

The full background is pretty much what you can see across all of the 9 posts below. Any subsequent backgrounds were obtained in the way I mentioned above.

I tried using this font selection a lot more consistently this time around, and I think it worked out.

Figuring out how to design the concert posts wasn't exactly easy, since I needed something more energetic than the regular style of posts. I wanted to keep the fonts consistent, so I mostly ended up playing with layouts and background effects. It turned out a bit hectic though.

# Placards

A pretty standard affair for the country placards. There were a fair few more than what I've shown below.

Part of this MUN was an F1 crisis committee, so we needed special placards for that. I had fun with the colours here.
