            <title>Avoiding the News</title>
            <link>https://shayanaqvi.github.io/articles/nonews/nonews.html</link>
            <description>I came across an article by Rolf Dobelli; it’s about avoiding the news. I don’t have much new to say about news in particular, not at this moment in time, but I just wanted to share some insights from this article that I found interesting. I don’t necessarily agree with all of these, but I found them interesting nonetheless.</description>
