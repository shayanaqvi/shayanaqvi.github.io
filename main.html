        <h2>here is your article, sir</h2>
        <p>This article is not about the problems of Vim. It’s about the problem of the concept of Vim. Not just Vim,
          for that matter, but similar software, such as Helix and company.
          Preamble
          <br>
          <br>
          For the sake of this article, I’m going to ignore any differences between text editors such as Vim and Neovim
          and Kakoune and Helix and the other millions of terminal text editors. To me, at least, the benefit (or the
          main benefit) of these text editors is not their performance or plugins or features or whatever. It’s the
          modal text editing. That’s what keeps me hooked to these amazing pieces of software.
          The Problem
          <br>
          <br>
          My problem with getting used to this kind of text editing is that you become so accustomed to it, that it
          becomes genuinely difficult adjusting to any plain ol’ non-modal text editor. Now, after about a year of using
          modal text editing as a primary way of manipulating text, I find it gruesome using non-modal text editing.
          <br>
          <br>

          If you’re a Vim user, you have an amount of luck, in this regard. There exist web extensions and VSCode
          extentions and Obsidian extentions (and so on) that let you use Vim’s modal editing in their apps. This is
          great, and while most of these are nowhere near perfect, they get you most of the way. Then, it’s possible to
          use alternatives to Vim while maintaining its modal editing.
          <br>
          <br>

          But if you use a more obscure text editor, like Helix or Kakoune, then you’re pretty much out of options. Some
          apps offer Kakoune’s modal editing, but very, very few offer Helix’s modal editing (all I recall is a VSCode
          extension). This brings us to the problem: an abundance of alternatives. Of this abundance of alternatives,
          very few are available to you if you wish to retain your text editing muscle memory.
          <br>
          <br>

          Thing is, this is perfectly okay. I shouldn't expect major pieces of software to have extensions for niche
          text editing apps. That expectation is not realistic, is it?
          <br>
          <br>

          Of course, I could simply switch back to Vim, have my piece of cake and eat it too, but honestly, I’d rather
          not (my, rather subjective opinion, is that Helix’s modal editing is superior to Vim’s).
          <br>
          <br>

          Regardless, if this is the case, I suppose I don’t have any right to complain. Thus, I shall stop right here.
          <br>
          <br>

          I came across an article by Rolf Dobelli; it’s about avoiding the news. I don’t have much new to say about
          news in particular, not at this moment in time, but I just wanted to share some insights from this article
          that I found interesting. I don’t necessarily agree with all of these, but I found them interesting
          nonetheless.

          “Take the following event. A car drives over a bridge, and the bridge collapses. What does the news media
          focus on? On the car. On the person in the car. Where he came from. Where he planned to go. How he experienced
          the crash (if he survived). What kind of person he is (was). But – that is all completely irrelevant. What’s
          relevant? The structural stability of the bridge. That’s the underlying risk that has been lurking and could
          lurk in other bridges. That is the lesson to be learned from this event. The car doesn’t matter at all. Any
          car could have caused the bridge to collapse. It could have been a strong wind or a dog walking over the
          bridge. So, why does the media cover the car? Because it’s flashy, it’s dramatic, it’s a person
          (non-abstract), and it’s news that’s cheap to produce.”
          “You don’t visit Paris for just one hour or speed through the Museum of Modern Art in two minutes. Why not?
          Because the brain needs spool-up time. Building up concentration takes a minimum of a 10­‐minute read. Given
          less time, your brain will process the information superficially and barely store it. News pieces are like
          wind hitting your cheek. Ask yourself: What are the top ten news items from a month ago (that are no longer in
          the news today)? If you have a hard time remembering, you are not alone. Why would you want to consume
          something that doesn’t add to your body of knowledge?”
          “News works like a drug. As stories develop, we naturally want to know how they continue. With hundreds of
          arbitrary story lines in our heads, this craving is increasingly compelling and hard to ignore.”
          “We are training our brains to pay attention to the crap.”
          “Fame is misleading because generally people become famous for reasons that have little relevance to our
          lives. The media grants fame to movie stars and news anchors for scant reason. News sunders the relationship
          between reputation and achievement. The tragedy is that pop notoriety crowds out the achievements of those who
          make more substantive contributions.”
          “Good professional journalists take time with their stories, authenticate their facts and try to think things
          through. But like any profession, journalism has some incompetent, unfair practitioners who don’t have the
          time – or the capacity – for deep analysis. You might not be able to tell the difference between a polished
          professional report and a rushed, glib, paid-by-the‐piece article by a writer with an ax to grind. It all
          looks like news. My estimate: fewer than 10% of the news stories are original. Less than 1% are truly
          investigative. And only once every 50 years do journalists uncover a Watergate. Many reporters cobble together
          the rest of the news from other people’s reports, common knowledge, shallow thinking and whatever the
          journalist can find on the internet. Some reporters copy from each other or refer to old pieces, without
          necessarily catching up with any interim corrections. The copying and the copying of the copies multiply the
          flaws in the stories and their irrelevance.”
          “Stories are selected or slanted to please advertisers (advertising bias) or the owners of the media
          (corporate bias), and each media outlet has a tendency to report what everyone else is reporting, and to avoid
          stories that will offend anyone (mainstream bias).”
          “Hold on: do we really want news reporters to set the public agenda?”
          “News stories are overwhelmingly about things you cannot influence.”
