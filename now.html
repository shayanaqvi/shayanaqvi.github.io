        <p>Some things I'm doing nowadays...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Working on this website<br>
            <p>Websites are something I have been messing around with for a <em>while</em> at this point now, maybe
              something like 2 years. This website is my first proper, serious attempt at making myself a website.
              Working out great, thus far.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Dipping my toes in data science/statistics<br>
            <p>I feel like this could be a possible career path for me. I'll have to wait and see if I actually want
              to pursue this as a career, but thus far, I feel like it's possible. I've put data science on hold for
              now, since I'd like to focus on statistics</p>
          </li>
          <li>Studying for the SAT<br>
            <p>This is something I plan on giving sometime next year. I don't need to say much about it, do I?</p>
          </li>
          <li>Cooking/baking<br>
            <p>I've tried baking plenty of breads during these holidays, and pretty much <em>all</em> of them turned
              out great!</p>
