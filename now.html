      <h1>What am I doing now?</h1>
      <h2>Studying</h2>
      <p>This is going to be a constant for quite a few months. Everything's great; net positive. Just need to apply
        myself for physics.</p>
      <h2>Enjoying the Weather</h2>
      <p>The weather getting colder is a nice change of pace, however, I'm finding myself not enjoying the cold as much
        as I used to. Regardless, I prefer the colder months over the warmer ones.</p>
      <h2>Listening to music</h2>
      <p>Jazz is a genre of music I thought I'd never like. I started listening to Sons of Kemet, and I'm loving their
        music thus far. Maybe it's this specific band, but I find myself liking it a lot.</p>
