        <p>Some things I'm doing nowadays...</p>
        <h2>Working on this website</h2>
        <p>Websites are something I have been messing around with for a <em>while</em> at this point now, maybe
          something like 2 years. This website is my first proper, serious attempt at making myself a website.
          Working out great, thus far.</p>
        <h2>Dipping my toes in data science/statistics</h2>
        <p>I feel like this could be a possible career path for me. I'll have to wait and see if I actually want
          to pursue this as a career, but thus far, I feel like it's possible. I've put data science on hold for
          now, since I'd like to focus on statistics</p>
        <h2>Studying for the SAT</h2>
        <p>This is something I plan on giving sometime next year. I don't need to say much about it, do I?</p>
        <h2>Cooking/baking</h2>
        <p>I've tried baking plenty of breads during these holidays, and pretty much <em>all</em> of them turned
          out great!</p>
