      <h1>What am I doing now?</h1>
      <h2>Studying</h2>
      <p>Ramping up the "intensity" of my studying. More frequent and more variety in what I'm studying. Still have a way to go though, but all in due time, of which there's plenty.</p>
      <h2>Working for an event</h2>
      <p>The Nobelium Cup. It's a sports event we're hosting at college. Working as a "director" of IT. I'm handling the graphics side of things with a co-director.</p>
      <p>I'll write about my thoughts on the work I produced after the event (the 16th through 18th of February). I do have some <em>opinions</em>.</p>
      <p>We have an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nobelium.cup/">Instagram page</a>!</p>
      <h2>Gaming</h2>
      <p>I acquired a Playstation Vita back in October/November of last year, I don't think I used it much until about December, when I got back into Minecraft. Yes, the Playstation Vita edition. It's old, but I have a lot of nostalgia for the legacy console editions of the game. It has issues with performance, but it's rather playable.</p>
      <p>I've gotten pretty far into NFS Most Wanted too. It's really novel playing that kind of game on something like a Vita. It does have a fair few technical issues though, especially with framerate, and overally I think it's a pretty average game. It's nice for what it is, but it's incredibly repetitive.</p>
      <p>Technical issues are kind of a recurring theme for Playstation Vita (and to an extent, Playstation Portable) games. Especially framerates. None of the games I've played thus far with framerate issues are unplayable, so to speak, but they're less than ideal.</p>
      <p>Midnight Club L.A. Remix is one of those games. God, the framerate in that game is quite annoying. It's <em>never</em> unplayable, but it's teetering on the edge of that.</p>
      <h2>Listening to Music</h2>
      <p>The Smile released a new record, and I love it. Within like a week of its release, it became my top album on Last FM. There's a lot of quality there. Also re-listening to A Light for Attracting Attention.</p>
      <p>Also some lesser known songs from Radiohead. Kinetic is amazing. Also their 2006 Bonnaroo concert is great.</p>
      <p>I put up Rocket Juice and the Moon on <em>theshelf</em> a while back, but I'm also re-listening to that. I really like Tony Allen's drumming. He did a track with Albarn, Go Back, on his 2014 album which I really like.</p>
      <p>Aphex Twin also. I racked up something like 600 scrobbles within about 2 weeks in December, if I recall correctly. Great music from him.</p>
