      <h2>Studying</h2>
      <p>Finals start in about 2 weeks!</p>
      <h2>Gaming</h2>
      <p>Working my way through Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII. Very nice game but I have some serious gripes with it. About 10 hours in so far.</p>
      <p>I did also get into Tekken for a bit, t'was my first time. I have a lot of respect now for people who are good at that game. A lot of effort is required to get good. Also Tekken 5 & 6 have v good soundtracks.</p>
      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>I spent about 2-3 weeks listening to close to nothing other than soundtracks from the Gran Turismo games. They're genuinely wonderful. GT 5 is probably my favourite, but to each their own! They're all great!</p>
