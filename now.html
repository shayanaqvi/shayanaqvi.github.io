      <h1>What am I doing now?</h1>
      <h2>Working on this website</h2>
      <p>Mostly solid at this point, but still tweaking things here and there. Working in plain HTML/CSS has its cons,
        but thus far I do enjoy its benefits.</p>
      <h2>Studying</h2>
      <p>College has started. It's my first of two years. One of my objectives this term is to just stay on top of
        things. I don't want to fall behind on things this time around, simply because I don't have that much time. I'm
        doing AS, by the way.</p>
      <p>But judging by the way the last few months of my IGCSEs went, I'm pretty confident that if I stay on top of
        things throughout the year, exam season should go just fine. I'll ignore all the horror stories I've heard about
        people's grades dipping from As in IGCSE to Cs in AS.</p>
      <h2>Enjoying the Weather</h2>
      <p>It's wonderfully hot, humid, sticky and sweaty where I live. You sense the sarcasm, don't you?</p>
      <h2>Listening to music</h2>
      <p>Mostly obsessed with Radiohead right now, as I have been for about a year. I'm enjoying Permanent Daylight,
        Gagging Order and a few songs from In Rainbows right now.</p>
      <p>Also came across Blur's Modern Life is Rubbish, from which I really like Chemical World and Blue Jeans.</p>
      <p>Massive Attack too. Angel is a wonderful song.</p>
