<ul>
<li>
<p>This website</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve migrated this website to Hugo! Before, I managed this website in plain HTML! There are benefits to this, but there was a lot, and I mean a lot, of friction when it came to actually putting things on the website.</p>
<p>This is mostly due to the amount of pages I had to manually update. If I was writing a blog post, I had to update wherever I was listing the articles and the RSS feed manually.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m managing the graphics/branding realm of this event alongside a co-director and a team of 2!</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="what-im-listening-to">What I&rsquo;m listening to</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ali Project</p>
<p>A pretty niche Japanese &ldquo;rock&rdquo; band, but from what I&rsquo;ve heard thus far there isn&rsquo;t much rock here. I&rsquo;m quite enjoying the little I&rsquo;ve heard from them, and it reminds me of Björk&rsquo;s music (there&rsquo;s this one song on their album <em>Noblerot</em> called <em>Lost Child</em>, and it sounds QUITE similar to <em>Hunter</em> by Björk).</p>
<p>A few of the songs I&rsquo;ve taken a liking to (I&rsquo;m very fond of numbers 5 &amp; 6):</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Coppelia no Hitsugi</em></li>
<li><em>Tozasareta Atelier</em></li>
<li><em>Otome no Inori</em></li>
<li>Rose Moon</li>
<li><em>Waga Routashi Aku no Hana</em></li>
<li><em>勇侠青春謳</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fishmans</p>
<p>Their 1998 live album is definitely my favourite so far, but I&rsquo;m also quite enjoying <em>Orange</em> (<em>Wasurechau Hitotoki</em> and <em>Yoru no Omoi</em> are particular favourites).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tame Impala</p>
<p>This is probably one of the last bands I thought I&rsquo;d be listening to, but there are a few songs off of their 2015 album <em>Currents</em> I quite enjoy. The first and last song, and a few in between.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NIGHTMARE</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only listened to their album <em>the WORLD Ruler</em>, but aside from the two songs there that are pretty well known (<em>the WORLD</em> and <em>Alumina</em>), there are a fair few other nice pieces there (<em>縷々〜lulu〜</em> comes to mind).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what-im-playing">What I&rsquo;m playing</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going through any particularly meaty games at the moment. I was going through the original <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>, but kind of gave up after beating the cool ninja guy boss. Not for any particular reason mind you, I was putting up with the oddities fairly well till that point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Having played <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> before this, I found the lack of a first-person aiming view a particular challenge. I had to change the way I aimed weapons to cope with this. Instead of aiming your weapon with the analog stick, aim with the D-Pad and shoot whenever an enemy comes into your line of fire.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from that, I&rsquo;ve been dabbling in a few &ldquo;non-story&rdquo; games, or games that work without paying attention to their story. Those are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Velocity 2X</li>
<li>Super Meat Boy</li>
<li>WipEout 2048</li>
<li>RESOGUN</li>
<li>NFS Most Wanted (2012)</li>
<li>Killzone Mercenary</li>
</ul>
<p><em>P.S. I use a Playstation Vita for my gaming fix.</em></p>
