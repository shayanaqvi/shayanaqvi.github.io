                <p><em>The work shown here was done through October/November of 2022.</em></p>
<p>As part of a school event (about math/science/arts), I did some design work, mostly for social media, including promotional material and the logo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve put some of my work for this event below.</p>
<figure class="image-shortcode" 
         style="">
    <img src="/img/msem/msem.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>Looking back on this, over a year later, there&rsquo;s one thing lacking: consistency. There&rsquo;s some, but it&rsquo;s not much, and everything looks all over the place. I find it a bit funny because I made a whole point of creating this thing:</p>
<figure class="image-shortcode frame" 
         style="width: 50%;">
    <img src="/img/msem/msem2.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>Primary/secondary/tertiary colours make no sense whatsoever. I recall being a bit hesitant with which colours to use for specific purposes. The only times I used these colours was in a gradient for the foreground.</p>
<p>There is a notion of consistency with most of the Instagram posts. It&rsquo;s not great but it is there. I think the problem was not landing on a consistent style of design before making everything. You can see a clear difference between the way the category details posts were designed and the way I did the event schedule. Gradients on the text, the colouring of the text, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Then comes the concert announcement. Complete change in style for these, and for no apparant reason! This definitely could have been done in same vain as the other posts.</p>
<p>The concert ticket is fine in a vacuum aside from the blending of the images. There are very visible seams and they do not look good.</p>
<p>The directorate ID cards are alright; black is somewhat understandable. The host team ID cards? Blue! Makes sense.</p>
<p>I suppose it&rsquo;s alright for a first. It could have been a lot better though.</p>
