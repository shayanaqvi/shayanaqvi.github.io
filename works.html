            <h2>This Website</h2>
            <p>This website aims to be pretty much HTML and CSS only. There is unfortunately some Javascript (comments),
              but it is very little. Moreover, it is an exercise in my HTML and CSS abilities, which till this point
              have been rather limited. I wouldn't say I'm some kind of HTML and CSS whiz now, but I would say I am
              somewhat better with this stuff now.</p>

            <h2>dpm</h2>
            <p>dpm is one more terminal frontend to MPD. It's purpose was for me to get more comfortable with
              programming in python (in that regard, time well spent âœ…). At this point in time, is is functional,
              however, it is important to note that there are still many holes in this project. Will I update this?
              Probably not. Should you use it? If you want to.</p>
