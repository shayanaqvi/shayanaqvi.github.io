This was an attempt at creating a font. It is, rather clearly, wonky,
very much so. However, given its status as a first attempt, I gave
myself that margin. I wanted to make *something*. *Something* did I
make. Here it is:

![first-image](./media/font1.png) ![second-image](./media/font2.png)
![third-image](./media/font3.png) ![fourth-image](./media/font4.png)
![fifth-image](./media/font5.png) ![sixth-image](./media/font6.png)
![seventh-image](./media/font7.png)

If you'd like to view this stuff in higher resolution, take a look at
