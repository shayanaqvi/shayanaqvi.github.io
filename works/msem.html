      <h1>MSEM</h1>
      <p>As part of a school event (about math/science/arts), I did some
        design work, mostly for social media, including promotional material and
        the logo.</p>
      <p>This figure was made about a year ago, and some things in this just ain't right. Regardless:</p>
      <figure style="">
        <img src="../articles/media/msem.png" alt="all works relating to MSEM" />
      </figure>
      <p>Looking back on this, over a year later, there's one thing lacking: consistency. There's <em>some</em>, but
        it's not much, and everything looks all over the place. I find it a bit funny because I made a whole point of
        creating this thing:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../articles/media/msem2.png" alt="design language guidelines">
      </figure>
      <p>The fonts stayed the same, but the colours? They stayed only for the logo! It's just all over the place after
        that. Some posts have red accents, some green, some purple, some with accents taken from the image. And where
        did that blue come from on the ID cards of the team members? Why is the background of the director ID cards
        black?</p>
      <p>The concert ticket is pretty ugly too: I can't stand the way I blurred the seams of the photos. Why has
        Jetbrains Mono been used there!? The margin on the right side is pretty bland too.</p>
      <p>A year of hindsight really does something I guess. I remember kind of liking the ticket design.</p>
      <p>There is one thing I do like about my efforts here: the logo itself. Not the text in it (I think the
        positioning of the "2022" is unfortunate) but the actual logomark. I still find it kind of impressive that I was
        able to come up with something at all. I wouldn't say it's a conventionally <em>good</em> logo: it doesn't scale
        particularly well, but all things considered, this was a first for me!</p>
      <p>The juniour batch of classes to mine last year is now doing this event again. There were, and are, a bunch of
        problems in the way the school administration handled this event, but that's a whole tangent I don't want to go
        on. They are, however, using a slightly modified version of this logo for this year. I can't help but feel a
        <em>little</em> bit smug knowing I designed it.
      </p>
      <p>But putting all of this aside, it's definitely a start. It was my first time doing something as extensive as
        this for a single project, and it does indeed look like a first time. But all things start somewhere, don't
        they?</p>
