      <h1>MSEM</h1>
      <p>As part of a school event (about math/science/arts), I did some
        design work, mostly for social media, including promotional material and
        the logo.</p>
      <p>This figure was made about a year ago, and some things in this just ain't right. Regardless:</p>
      <figure style="">
        <img src="../images/msem//msem.png" alt="all works relating to MSEM" />
      </figure>
      <p>Looking back on this, over a year later, there's one thing lacking: consistency. There's <em>some</em>, but
        it's not much, and everything looks all over the place. I find it a bit funny because I made a whole point of
        creating this thing:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/msem//msem2.png" alt="design language guidelines">
      </figure>
      <p>Primary/secondary/tertiary colours make no sense whatsoever. I recall being a bit hesitant with which colours to use for specific purposes. The only times I used these colours was in a gradient for the foreground.</p>
      <p>There is a notion of consistency with most of the Instagram posts. It's not great but it is there. I think the problem was not landing on a consistent style of design before making everything. You can see a clear difference between the way the category details posts were designed and the way I did the event schedule. Gradients on the text, the colouring of the text, so on and so forth.</p>
      <p>Then comes the concert announcement. Complete change in style for these, and for no apparant reason! This definitely could have been done in same vain as the other posts.</p>
      <p>The concert ticket is fine in a vacuum aside from the blending of the images. There are very visible seams and they do not look good.</p>
      <p>The directorate ID cards are alright; black is somewhat understandable. The host team ID cards? Blue! Makes sense.</p>
      <p>I suppose it's alright for a first. It could have been a lot better though.</p>
      <p class="closing">The word shown here was done through October/November of 2022. If you have any thoughts, feel free to send me an email with them. Have a nice day!</p>
