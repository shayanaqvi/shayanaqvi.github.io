      <h1>Muqabila e Ilm o Hisaab</h1>
      <p><em>Muqabila e Ilm o Hisaab</em> was a math olympiad we did as a group of friends (we called this group 'Mehfil'). We collaborated with a private tuition academy, <em>Rubrics</em>, to host it.</p>
      <p>The work I did here is nowehere near my best, but there are a few things here I do like. I'll be showing those below.</p>

      <p>I also did a version with the colours flipped, and we ended up using it:</p>

      <h2>Question & Answer Sheets</h2>
      <p>I'm only going to put one page of the question sheet below, but you can see the <a href="../images/mioh/qs.pdf">full version</a> as a PDF.</p>

      <h2>Proposal</h2>
      <p><a href="../images/mioh/proposal.pdf">Here's the full document</a>. We showed this to the guys at Rubrics to get them on board. The colours here were before we decided on a palette for the olympiad.</p>
