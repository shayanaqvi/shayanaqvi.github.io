      <h1>The Nobelium Cup</h1>
      <p>The Nobelium Cup is a multi-format sports tournament, put simply.</p>
      <p>I'll put <em>most</em> things I did here, what I won't put are all of the Instagram posts. If the page is still
        up in its current form (as of February 2024), you can view all the posts <a
          href="https://www.instagram.com/nobelium.cup/">here</a>. Any videos on this page are <em>not</em> my work.</p>
      <p>I did all of this work in Figma. Here's a screenshot of the end-point of this file:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/nobelium-end-point.png">
      </figure>
      <p>I thought there'd be a <em>tad</em> bit more here.</p>
      <p>All things considered, I'm happy with the way this turned out. Definitely an improvement over the way things
        went for MSEM and the way things <em>would</em> have gone if PMUN was a thing.</p>
      <p>It isn't perfect, and there are things I'm not happy with, but again - net positive. The style of design I went
        for works when it works, but when it doesn't work, I think it really doesn't work. That's my main sticking
        point.</p>

      <h2>1.0: The Instagram Posts</h2>
      <p>One of the things I wanted to avoid was the background continuity thing between posts on the grid. While that
        sorta page does look nice, it's a lot of work to maintain that layout. Whenever you need to post something, you
        need to post in batches of 3. The page we did for Nobelium was a mix of these. I wanted <em>all</em> posts to
        work on their own with no continuity between them, different backgrounds and all. It started off that way, but I
        did not follow it throughout.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/initialposts.png">
        <figcaption>I think this looks great!</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This is what I was going for. My mistake here was not stress testing this style of design. You can only make so
        many of these kinds of backgrounds before you start recycling some or modifying old ones. I'm going to admit - I
        did do that.</p>
      <p>By the way, I got my inspiration for this kind of design from <a
          href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/123833955/TheTradeDesk-Solimar-Launch?tracking_source=search_projects&l=82&">this</a>
        page on Behance. I genuinely love it.</p>
      <p>I'm going to briefly touch upon the logo. I don't hate it, for a change. However, I still don't like it. There
        were, 100%, problems I had with scaling this logo to smaller sizes. It looked just fine medium or large, but it
        had problems small.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/nobposts2.png">
      </figure>
      <p>This was the second round of posts we uploaded. It was at this point I did begin to question whether I made the
        right choice with this kinda design. I genuinely hate these 3 posts. You know you've done something wrong when
        you start doubting it <em>this</em> early.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/nobposts3.png">
      </figure>
      <p>You know, for a while there, the page was a complete mess. I'm not going to say this 3x3 spread of posts looks
        particularly good. I don't think it does.</p>
      <h3>1.1: The Host Team</h3>
      <p>We uploaded the photos for the Executive Council (pretentious name, isn't really as pretentious as it may
        sound) first, before the directors. This was one of the things we did really well. The guys who took the photos
        are amazing photographers, and they did a great job with the actual photos.</p>
      <p>I wanted properly minimal graphics on top of these photos. I did just that, and I think I did that well.</p>
      <p>Here's the entire grid:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/nobposts4.png">
      </figure>
      <p>And here's one of the posts in isolation:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/nobposts5.png">
      </figure>
      <p>The positioning of the text is such that it isn't cropped or half-visible in the square format it is on the
        main page grid.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/nobposts6.png">
      </figure>
      <p>The text in the thumbnail does actually look that fuzzy. The title is kind of readable, but the subheading
        definitely isn't. I'm not exactly sure if that's a problem.</p>
      <p>Then came the directors. Was a bit more of a challenge to get a good layout given the amount that there are,
        but we settled on doing slides in this sort of format:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/nobposts7.png">
      </figure>
      <p>Here's the layout at the end:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/nobposts8.png">
      </figure>
      <p>Any department with multiple directors was relegated to a slides format. I wasn't exactly happy with this, but
        we also didn't want our entire page to be director photos.</p>
      <h3>1.2: Changing the Colours</h3>
      <p>After posting the Executive Council photos, we changed up our colours a fair bit. The purple/yellow combo was
        getting a bit repetitive. It did that job though, and freshened the page up a bit.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/nobposts9.png">
        <figcaption>Continuity!</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>We settled on these colours which we retained for the remainder of our page.</p>
      <h3>1.3: Fixtures</h3>
      <p>I genuinely thought making posts for fixtures would have been a 2 minute job, but this turned out to be quite a
        stressful endeavour.</p>
      <p>For most sports, we did a simple tabular layout:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/nobposts10.png">
      </figure>
      <p>For cricket, I was convinced to attempt a different layout. Mind you, I did rush making this so things do look
        a bit wonky here:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/nobposts11.png">
      </figure>
      <p>So on and so forth.</p>
      <h3>1.4: Instagram Stories</h3>
      <p>I did not have the leverage of posting all the stories on our Instagram page, and understandably so. I was able
        to make a few FAQ stories though.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/nobposts12.png">
      </figure>

      <h2>2.0: The Invite + Sponsorship Proposal</h2>
      <h3>2.1: The Invite</h3>
      <p>I'm going to get over with the invite first. Genuinely my first time making a printable document for this sort
        of purpose, it looks a bit wonky.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/invite1.png">
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/invite2.png">
      </figure>
      <p>For the number of invites we were going to print, we could only afford 1 page of colour printing. The rest is
        black & white.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/invite3.png">
      </figure>
      <p>The registration forms looked as such:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/invite4.png">
      </figure>
      <p>It's fine. That's it. I'd call it better than the standard of event invites you get for events of this caliber
        in this area, but it's still not particularly good.</p>
      <p>Moving on.</p>
      <h3>2.2: The Sponsorship Proposal</h3>
      <p>This went through two iterations, both of which we used.</p>
      <p>The first iteration was rather similar to the invite.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/sponsors1.png">
      </figure>
      <p>This is rather bland. The entire sponsorship proposal was a lot longer, but it was all text. Nothing else. We
        realized a bit later on that we could have done better. Better we did. In the week leading up to our event, for
        two potential sponsors (one of which was very promising but didn't work out).</p>
      <p>This one is a lot nicer.</p>
      <p><a href="../images/nobelium/sp.pdf">See full proposal</a>.</p>

        <img src="../images/nobelium/sponsors5.png">
      </figure>
      <p>Not perfect though, but a lot nicer.</p>

      <h2>3.0: Banners</h2>
      <p>We did two banners:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/banner1.png">
        <figcaption>Not a big fan of this, in all honesty</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/banner2.png">
        <figcaption>This one is nice</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>4.0: Standees</h2>
      <p>A fair few standees too.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/standees.png">
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/standees3.png">
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/standees2.png">
        <figcaption>The only IRL photo I have of a standee</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>5.0: ID Cards</h2>
      <p>These are the ID cards for the host team. About 150 people in it. Same design for all.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/idcards.png">
      </figure>
      <p>I did not optimize for printing enough. Ended up looking like this (forgive the abhorrent photo quality):</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/idcards2.png">
        <figcaption>The Nobelum Cup (that same error was printed on ALL cards!!!)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Text should have been larger. I'm going to experiment more next time.</p>
      <p>These are the ID cards for participants. Data was meant to be hand-written.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/idcards3.png">
      </figure>

      <h2>6.0: Certificates</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/certificate.png">
      </figure>

      <h2>7.0: Conclusion</h2>
      <p>As I stated before, net positive. This is the second event for which I've done this sort of work. Again, not
        everything went to plan. Not everything turned out exactly as I would have liked. But considering the kind of
        work I did for MSEM, there's something of an exponential improvement here. It's that much better to me.</p>

      <h2>8.0: Things I didn't use</h2>
      <p>I stared work on Nobelium either in late December or early January. I'm going to put up some of what I made but
        didn't use here.</p>
      <p>Some of the earlier logos:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/unused1.png">
      </figure>
      <p>The rightmost one is inspired from the Smash Bros logo. That sort of concept is something I really like, and I
        feel like it could use a lot more work. It has potential though. Maybe next year.</p>
      <p>An earlier page-layout idea:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/unused2.png">
      </figure>
      <p>Was testing out using Cormorant Unicase as a header font in the middle row, the original idea was for a
        monospace font.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/unused3.png">
      </figure>
      <p>This was the most fleshed-out concept I had, and I still really like it. Needs work, of course, but I really
        like it and I'm 100% going to consider using it for next year's Nobelium.</p>
      <p>ID card concepts in the same vain:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/unused4.png">
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/unused5.png">
        <figcaption>Up for consideration next year too!</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/unused6.png">
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/unused7.png">
        <figcaption>A different kind of Instagram page layout. Placeholder logo.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/unused8.png">
        <figcaption>Experimenting with colours.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/nobelium/unused9.png">
        <figcaption>I really like these too. The 2 classes I bunked to design this with my co-director was honestly one
          of the most fruitful sessions I've had in recent memory. This came up without too much effort.</figcaption>
        <figcaption>The ball is quite reminiscient of the ICC logo, though, so that's gonna have to change if I use this
          next year. Definitely up for consideration though.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>9.0: The end!</h2>
      <p>That's that.</p>
