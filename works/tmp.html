<p>This was an attempt at creating a font. It is, rather clearly, wonky,
very much so. However, given its status as a first attempt, I gave
myself that margin. I wanted to make <em>something</em>.
<em>Something</em> did I make. Here it is:</p>
<p><img src="./media/font1.png" alt="first-image" /> <img
src="./media/font2.png" alt="second-image" /> <img
src="./media/font3.png" alt="third-image" /> <img
src="./media/font4.png" alt="fourth-image" /> <img
src="./media/font5.png" alt="fifth-image" /> <img
src="./media/font6.png" alt="sixth-image" /> <img
src="./media/font7.png" alt="seventh-image" /></p>
